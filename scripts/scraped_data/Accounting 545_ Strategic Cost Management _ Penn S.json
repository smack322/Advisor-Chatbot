        "The requirement weightings and the final grade determination, using the scale below, is based on your results on the the weekly mini-case analyses and write-ups, weekly module quizzes, and the semester project. Professionalism IS EXPECTED.",
        "Note: A grade of “C” or higher is required to pass the course.",
        "Assignment Descriptions",
        "1) Weekly “Mini-Case” Write-Ups (40% of grade):",
        "These “mini-case” assignments will be assigned on a weekly basis and must be completed using EXCEL. You need to study the case and create thoughtful solutions to the questions posed, with proper analysis developed on an Excel Spreadsheet. Each weekly “mini-case” assignment is scored out of 100 pts, with point distribution spread amongst the 1-3 cases required each week.  I do not expect you to get all of these problems 100% “correct” each week.  However, I do expect you to make an intelligent, determined, and thoughtful effort to address the issues introduced in each problem.  All write-ups will be done on an individual basis. Obvious noting of collaboration will be dealt with amongst the instructor and students, with an academic integrity violation possibility.",
        "All weekly assignments are due by 11:59 PM on Sunday evenings. No late assignments will be accepted for ANY reason. Thus, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE as technology sometimes has issues. We will submit all assignments via Canvas. YOU MUST use your PSU login ID/email to appropriately utilize PSU Canvas. If there are assignment submission issues with Canvas on a given day, then other submission arrangements may be made, but only after consulting with the instructor BEFORE 11:59 PM on Sunday. Again, be sure to also include your name and date of assignment on the inside of your Excel file.",
        "Expectations for Write-Up Work for “Problems/Mini-Case Analyses”",
        "It is imperative that your work represents high quality and professionalism. Sloppy and unprofessional work will be scored as a zero regardless of content. This includes proper grammar and spelling. Please proofread your work. I will deduct points for a poorly written analysis. Besides, a poorly formatted spreadsheet will be scored a zero. Proper formatting includes a readable font, headings, labels, your name, etc. Pay attention to how your spreadsheets are created and organized. Again, I do not expect you to get all of these problems 100% “correct” each week. However, I do expect you to make a reasonable effort to address the issues introduced in each problem. The grade for the Write-Up Work will be determined by the quality and completeness of your answers as below.",
        "*Assignments Rubric",
        "I use the above as a guide for grading each case and then quantify up to 100 points based on your results.Solutions: Solutions to the Recommend Problems/Mini-Case write-ups will be provided on Canvas after the assignments have been submitted.",
        "2) Weekly Lesson-Based Quizzes (and orientation assignments) – (10% of grade):",
        "These quizzes are based on the material covered in each associated lesson. Students will be given 2 attempts to take the quiz and must complete it in one sitting. There is a  lesson-based quiz for each Module. Each quiz is equally weighted.  In addition to the weekly Module Quizzes, your Orientation Syllabus Quiz and Welcome Discussion will be scored in this course requirement. Each module quiz is timed and you are given 30 minutes. There is no save button, but assessment navigation is enabled so that you should be able to select a question and return to it if need be. A quiz will auto-submit after 30 minutes of time. The highest score of the two attempts will be used to determine your final grade.",
        "3) Semester Project – (50% of grade):",
        "A major requirement for this course is the completion of the semester project. The project requires each student to create of a detailed budgeting financial model and then make  subsequent decision-making analysis based on the model. It requires each student to prepare a master budget plan and to perform budget analysis and research. Details and instructions for completion is located in the Semester Project Module.  You have approximately 16 weeks to complete the project (which includes our Thanksgiving Break) so it is critical that you start early and ask the instructor question as you move forward.",
        "You each bring your unique educational experiences to the table, as well as any work experience from summer work, internships, etc. So you have much to contribute to the course. Also, the emphasis on class participation serves to develop your skills to think, present, and respond to others. This is what is expected of you as you move into your careers as corporate decision-makers. The ultimate analysis/conclusions will formulate out of your analysis and discussion.",
        "Penn State puts a very high value on academic integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is one of Penn State’s four principles to which all students must abide.",
        "Any violation of academic integrity will receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned accordingly.",

        "There are MANY USERS of the accounting system:",
        "The wheel of decision-making is where we operate within our organization and where we are eventually going to end up in this class. After building our foundational toolbox in the early modules of the course, we use those tools to learn how to complete analysis to make better, data-driven decisions, and also learn how to control our operations.",
        "Let’s now move on to summarize the “incentives” of cost allocation.",
        "What are Activities? Activities are events or tasks performed by each specialized group or activity center within the operation that causes the consumption of overhead resources (e.g., taking a customer’s order). Each activity is a cost center. For example, imagine the costs generated just by taking a customer’s order. This activity creates cost for the organization in a number of ways including employees, computers, internet access, phone lines, telephones, data usage, electricity, offices, desks, chairs, paper for creating purchase orders or special multi-copy purchase orders, printers, ink, envelopes, stamps, etc. (We’re sure you can think of more!) So we identify the activities, then costs are first assigned to activities. Then, these activity center costs are then directly traced to products or allocated to products using a cost driver rate.",
        "Simple!  Hmm…. Does this sound familiar?  It should. This is just like computing a predetermined overhead rate under absorption costing.",
        "First, we determine the type of transactions that generate the costs in each factory and/or support (administrative) department. We ask, “What drives the cost in each department or activity center?” Second, we then determine the type of cost driver. The driver will fit into one these five general activity level categories below.",
