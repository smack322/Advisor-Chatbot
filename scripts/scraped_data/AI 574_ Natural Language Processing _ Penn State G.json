        "The study of NLP refers to the automatic manipulation of natural languages, like speech and text. Most work in NLP – which has both theoretical and applied elements – is aimed at making computers understand text and identify meaningful information and eventually improve the relationship between computers and basic language. NLP encompasses approaches to help machines understand, interpret, and generate human languages. For this reason, NLP is sometimes described as natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) methods.",
        "The illustration in Figure 7.1 below shows the text generation from trained n-gram language model given the initial context including a sequence with one word (e.g., “I”). The next step is to generate the probability distribution given the word “I”, and then randomly get a sample (e.g., “was”) from the distribution. The sample will be appended to the sequence and become the current context (i.e., “I was”). These steps are repeated and the new sequence becomes “I was happy” .",
        "Figure 7.1: Text generation (credit: Elena Voita )",
        "Deep learning has played a critical role in the rapid growth of automatic speech recognition (ASR). The task of automatic speech recognition is to convert spoken language into computer-readable text. Due to the variety of speech sounds that humans are capable of producing, ASR is tightly coupled with computational linguistics and phonetics. In ASR, digitized speech signals are converted into computer-readable text, referred to as transcripts. Basically, ASR involves mapping audio samples to a sequence of words representing the transcript (Figure 12.1 below).",

        "One real-world example of applying NLP concepts can be seen in the e-commerce industry. A major online retailer sought to improve its customer experience by implementing a personalized product recommendation chatbot. The goal was to help customers quickly find products they were searching for while also increasing cross-sell and upsell opportunities. However, the initial chatbot relied on a keyword-based search system, which failed to understand customer intent or provide relevant recommendations. This led to customer frustration, reduced engagement, and lost sales opportunities.",
        "To address this, the company turned to an NLP team to redesign the chatbot using state-of-the-art techniques. By employing pre-trained language models like BERT and fine-tuning them on the company’s domain-specific data, the team was able to develop a chatbot that understood customer queries in context. For example, when a customer asked, “What’s the best phone for gaming?” the chatbot was able to recommend high-performance smartphones with features tailored for gaming. The system also used sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction during interactions and adjusted its responses accordingly.",
        "The revamped chatbot dramatically improved the customer experience by providing accurate, personalized product recommendations. This led to increased sales, higher customer satisfaction, and stronger brand loyalty. The success of this project illustrates how concepts taught in AI 574, such as machine learning for language modeling, intent detection, and sentiment analysis, can have a tangible impact on solving real-world business problems.",
