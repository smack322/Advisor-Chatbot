        "A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). The following grading system applies to graduate students:",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95 – 100, A- = 90 – 94, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 84- 86, B- = 80 – 83, C+ = 77 – 79, C = 70 – 76, D = 60 – 69, and F = below 60.",
        "There will be two written assignments during the course: Reflection & Synthesis (R&S) #1 and #2. These are due at the end of Lessons 2 and 5, respectively. The purpose of these assignments is to help you reflect upon, analyze, synthesize, and apply the material covered in this course. You are welcome to work together in the early stages of these assignments (e.g., discussing your ideas, pondering approaches, recommending references), but the final product must be entirely your own individual work.",
        "There will be discussion forums associated with each lesson. You are required to log on to every discussion forum and to post at least one original response related to the assigned topic as well as a minimum of two substantive responses (in general) to your classmates’ postings. The specific posting requirements will be included along with the discussion topic for each forum. You are not required to follow threads from previous lessons, but you are always welcome to post comments that relate to any previous discussion if they also relate to the current theme in some way.",
        "There will be two exams: one midterm exam (20% of course grade) and one final exam (20% of course grade). The purpose of these exams is to ensure your ready recall of fundamental concepts and key points covered in this course; they will not focus on minute details (e.g., no dates). In terms of format, all exams will be primarily (if not completely) multiple choice, with the possibility of a few short answer questions.",
        "The Exams may be proctored online using proctoring software that uses your computer’s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record your activity during exams. The proctoring software may be listening to you, monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, and recording any activity (including visual and audio recordings) during the proctoring process.",

        "Let’s take a look at Wallas’ model for the thinking process.",
        "This model may be familiar to you already, with its four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.",
        "There are many engineering design methodologies taught and used in academia and industry. Each one is a process aimed at solving problems of design and invention.  Let’s look at the example shown below and begin an analysis.",
        "The design methodology shown here was originally developed for hardware design, but the general template can be adapted for any engineered system. Note, too (as mentioned in the excerpt below the figure), that even this fairly detailed diagram (like all processes) is an idealization; in actual implementation, engineers using this design methodology may skip stages or operate using a less formal structure, particularly in small companies.",
        "In the first case (recognition of need), we can expect a person’s level (knowledge, experience, etc.) to have a direct effect on the opportunities (needs) that person perceives to be important – so, for example, an expert may focus on more complex or advanced gaps in technology than a novice in the field. Likewise, in terms of style, we might expect a more innovative engineer to find opportunities that span several technical domains to be of greater interest, while a more adaptive colleague prefers to focus on critical gaps within a single domain. And so on.",
        "In the case of proposal evaluation, one’s level will impact how deeply and accurately one can evaluate another person’s work, and one’s style is bound to impact one’s judgment of the proposed solution. So, for example, a more adaptive evaluator may find a particular proposal to be lacking in detail, while a more innovative reviewer finds the detail provided in the same proposal stifling! Once again, these variations represent only a small sampling of the cognitive diversity we can expect to see, but they should be enough to get you started on a deeper investigation.",
        "In this lesson we explore problem-solving leadership, and here, all the concepts and issues that underlie our understanding of the individual problem solver and problem solving teams must be revisited, but from a new perspective: the problem solving leader. The focus is the leadership of all, one’s social role within the team (“me, facilitating others”), and the responsibilities inherent in managing oneself and others (obligation vs. reward – or “right to be in the team”). In dealing with problem solving leadership, we must move beyond an understanding of the management of change to a teaching program for how to do it.",
        "When leadership is the focus, our fundamental aim is mutual effective achievement. Our main element of theory here is the management of diversity as the foundation for the management of change, as well as the dangers of success (an outcome of the catalytic nature of change and our escalating expectations and demands for success). Finally, our practical entry points are the Pendulum of Change and (in contrast to) the Spiral of Change, two particular patterns for the progression of change. The first (the Pendulum) represents what hap­pens when change is managed poorly (a pendulum swinging between extremes with little forward motion), and the second describes change managed well (a catalytic spiral of upward progress) – both in the context of the team and leadership.",
