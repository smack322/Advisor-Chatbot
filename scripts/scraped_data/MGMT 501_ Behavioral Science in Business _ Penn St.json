Students are asked to apply course concepts to their own experiences and/or observed phenomena in organizations. To encourage this application, each class meeting will begin with student-led discussion. Working in teams or individually, students are asked to choose, define, and “contextualize” a concept, construct, or phenomenon described in the assigned readings for the week. When, where, and why is this concept applicable in organizational and/or managerial practice? What experience do students in the course have with respect to a concept or construct? How does understanding this concept help to explain or predict people’s behavior in organizations?",

An annotated bibliography includes a list of journal articles, books, and other publications that a student considers relevant to the topic selected for the individual paper.  A paper title and a brief statement or paragraph that describes the thesis and goals of the student’s planned individual paper should be provided at the beginning of the annotated bibliography. The heading “Annotated Bibliography” should follow this introductory paragraph, followed by a list of references, formatted according to APA style for references, alphabetized by the last name of the first author of each article. A brief paragraph of “annotations,” which describes the details from the publication most relevant to the topic, should follow each reference. These annotations should concisely describe the focus of the reference and explain what is/may be relevant or useful to the student’s individual paper. Why cite this reference in the paper? References should be double-spaced and indented after the first line, but annotations may be single-spaced. A minimum of eight (8) references are required for the annotated bibliography.  Of these, at least four should be from the recommended scholarly journals. A list of appropriate journals to consult is provided below.  Please refer to the example and the grading rubric available in Canvas for this assignment.",

The purpose of this academic writing exercise is to apply theories and concepts that you have become familiar with in the course and apply them to problems or opportunities that occur in the practice of management. The paper must include references to relevant academic research as well as timely business/practitioner (“popular”) literature.  In preparing to write this paper, students should review the literature on a topic of interest and decide on a thesis or overall conclusion that s/he would like to explain in the paper.  Arguments that support or criticize the research literature reviewed based on other authors’ ideas or the student’s own experience should be included in the paper. Students must include citations from articles published in one or more of the scholarly academic journals listed below. The references list in this paper should include only articles used (i.e., “referred to”) in the paper. Length should be 7-10 pages plus a title page and references, double spaced, 12-point font.  The in-text citations and corresponding references must be formatted according to APA style.  Please refer to the assignment description and grading rubric for this assignment, available online in Canvas.",
