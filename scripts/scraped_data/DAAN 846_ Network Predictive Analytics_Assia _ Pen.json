        "*Subject to change",
        "Humans live in a connected world. Everything from social media to institutions (such as a government), processes (such as an economy), and infrastructures (such as a global airline network) form a complex network. But humans are not unique in being part of an interconnected system. We see complex networks in an entire ecosystem, interacting genes and communicating neurons. Network-based perspective, therefore, has been found to be useful in the study of complex systems in:",
        "There has also been a growing interest in sciences in the recent past to move away from the reductionist approach that focused on studying fundamental parts of a complex system. A system-level perspective considers a system as more than a sum of its parts and tries to understand emergent behavior that results from the interation of these parts.",
        "For this course, our interest will be in economic, political and social interactions shaped by social networks. Social networks play an important role in trade of goods and services, how we vote, how much education we obtain, whether we become criminals or succeed professionally. The myriad of ways in which a social network affects our lives raises many important questions:",
        "Networks are represented using graphs where the nodes or vertices of the graph denote people or other entities, and the edges or links denote connections, relationships, or ties between the nodes. Depending on the field of your study, you may find nodes and edges described using other synonymous terms. Edges may have an intensity, i.e., they may be weighted. For example, if the network represents connections between colleagues at an institution, the weight of an edge may indicate the the number of hours they spend working together each week or the number of articles they have published together. Edges may also be unweighted. For instance, we may have a link between two people if they are friends with each other or no link otherwise. The edges may be undirected or directed with the direction of the edge indicating the direction of the relationship. Undirected edges may indicate mutual relationships such as two people being friends whereas directed edges indicate one-way relationship such as one webpage linked to the other but the other not linked to the one.",
        "shows an example of an undirected network represented as a graph and an adjacency matrix. The row and column numbers in the adjacency matrix represent the nodes of the network. A 0 at the intersection of a row and column indicates that the nodes represented by the particular row and column number are not linked; a 1 instead would indicate that they are linked.",
        "We typically give a network a name such as the letter g, the row numbers are denoted by the letter i, and the column numbers by the letter j. We can, therefore, say the gij = 1 if nodes i and j are linked. For example, g12 = 1 indicates that the nodes 1 and 2 are linked together. Since the graph is undirected, notice that it is also symmetric. For example, if g12 = 1 then g21 is also 1.",
        "An adjacency matrix is a convenient way to represent a network and lends itself easily to manipulation using linear algebra. But when we start working with very large networks (millions of nodes), a matrix can become rather large to load in the memory of a computer and work with. An alternative way to represent a network is using a list. For instance, the network of Figure 1 as a list could be represented as g = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {3,5}} or even g = {12, 13, 15, 23, 25, 34, 35}. The advantage that a list has over a network is that it is much more economical especially when a large matrix is sparse, i.e., there are only a few links in the network leaving most of the entries in the matrix as 0. Also, we sometimes are more interested just in the links rather than the whole matrix. Lists make it easier to keep track of the links.",
        "Figure 2 shows a graph and adjacency matrix for a directed network. The significant difference to notice that edges are directional and there is the lack of symmetry in the adjacency matrix. For instance, node 2 is connected to 5 but not the other way around. Also note that the convention is to indicate all outgoing edges from a node on its corresponding row. So the column can be thought of as indicating all the incoming edges into a node represented by that column.",
        "The list representation for this network would g = {12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35, 41, 45}. One thing to note here is that the order of the nodes matter. For instance, we have a link 14 indicating a directed edge from 1 to 4 but we also have a link 41 indicating an edge in the other direction. We must now keep track of all directional edges.",
        "Networks can also be weighted. A weighted network puts weights on the edges between its nodes as shown in Figure 3.",
        "We can imagine this figure to represent a learning network where nodes are individuals who form opinions based on the information they receive from other nodes. For instance:",
        "Another interesting observation about the adjacency matrix in Figure 3 is that all of the wieghts are non-negative and each row adds up to 1, i.e., ∑j gij = 1. Such networks are called row stochastic networks. Not all wieghted networks need to be row stochastic. For instance, the network in Figure 4 shows emails being exchanged among individuals and the number of emails from one individual to the others don’t have to add up to 1.",
        "All the representations we have seen so far are static but networks can evolve or change with time. We will examine ways for representing dynamic networks in a future lesson.",
        "Now that we know how networks are represented, in the next section we’ll look at how to charcterize networks by measuring some of their properties.",
        "Basic topographical measures such as size, average distance, and diameter provide information on a network as an aggregate, giving analysts an ability to gauge the overall potential of the network in terms of capacity and performance and also providing a context within which to interpret other measures that may come further down the analysis pipeline. Table 1 provides a summary of these measures.",
        "Network size is simply a count of the number of actors in a network. Knowing a network’s size is important when interpreting measures sensitive to it, such as density or diameter. For instance, it is meaningless to compare densities of networks that are dissimilar in size.",
        "Size can also be used to understand if a network is growing or shrinking over time. A dark network that is consistently growing is likely recruiting successfully. Analysts should be careful, however, and understand how the boundaries of a network have been defined or else they may not be looking at the true size of the network.",
        "Average distance places more emphasis on the ties between actors within a network. It is measured as the average length of all the shortest paths or geodesics between all actors in a network. It provides an analyst with a means to determine how fast information can spread throughout a given network.",
        "All things being equal, networks with lower average distance should be more efficient in diffusing information and resources than those with a higher average distance. This information can be used to formulate a deception campaign strategy that relies on spreading disinformation to undermine the operations of a dark network. However, care has to be taken with the timing of such campaigns since networks are dynamic and the average distance of a network is likely to change with time.",
        "Network diameter measures a network’s longest geodesic and indicates how dispersed a network is. Networks with large diameters may be more dispersed than those with small ones. Dispersed or decentralized networks are better suited to solving complex and challenging problems while maintaining their operational security when compared to more centralized or hierarchical networks. However, since a network diameter is closely related to its size, we should be careful when comparing diameters of networks of different sizes.",
        "The basic topographical measures highlight some tradeoffs that dark networks may face and provide evidence for the potential of these networks. These relationships, however, may not be as clear cut and, therefore, these measures should, at first blush, be used just as an evidence of potential. For instance, a network with small average distance could be vulnerable to misinformation campaigns but could equally prevent disinformation from spreading among its members.",
