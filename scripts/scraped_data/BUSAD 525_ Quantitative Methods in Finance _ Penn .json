        "Probability model is an idealized conception of how reality works. For example, when I roll a fair die, each of the six faces is equally likely to occur, which indicates the probability of the occurrence of each number is 1/6. On the other hand, statistics tells us how we use a sample of data to calibrate our probability model. Using the die example again, if the probability of the occurrence for each face is difficult to determine, we can roll the die many times to count the proportion of times each face came up. We can then approximate the probability of the each face by using its corresponding proportions.",
        "In the above experiment, the outcome of rolling a die is unknown and in statistics, we call such an uncertain outcome as a random variable. A random variable is usually denoted by X where one specific outcome is denoted by x.",
        "In the example of rolling a die, the random variable, X, can take a value from 1 to 6. If there are only a finite number of distinct values of a random variable, it is called a discrete random variable. Examples of discrete random variables include the number of children in a family, the Friday night attendance at a cinema, the number of defective light bulbs in a box of ten. However, in the stock market, a stock’s price is also a random variable, but unlike the outcome of rolling a die, it has many more outcomes. If we cannot count the possible outcomes of a random variable (it has infinite number of outcomes), it is called continuous random variable. Examples include height, weight, the stock returns in percentage, and the time required to run a mile.",
        "The set or list of all possible values of a discrete random variable, with their associated probabilities, is called the probability distribution (denoted by p(x)). For a continuous random variable, the probability function is denoted by f(x) and is called the probability density function (pdf).",
        "Let’s assume that you toss two coins in the air and let X be the number of times heads comes up. What is the probability distribution?",

        "A mutual fund’s return level and its corresponding probabilities are shown in the following table:",
        "Let’s try to answer the following questions in the video below:",
        "Refer to the worksheet named Example 2 located within the Module 1 Examples, which contains the observed data.",
        "In this example, we will demonstrate the concept of probability and cumulative probability density functions. Here we have one example of mutual funds. We know that the different levels of the returns and its corresponding probabilities. So we want to compute what is the probability of a mutual fund that has 9% of return? And then what is the cumulative density function that the return level is less than 9%? The last question is, what is the probability of the funds earning between 3%, 7 percent? So by looking at this table here, we see that if we want to use the random variable x to represent the return level, and that this is definitely a discrete random variable. If you remember from the lecture notes that the discrete random variable has a finite number of outcomes. So in this case, x will only have four different possible values. That’s why it is a discrete random variable. So in order to answer the first question, if the return level is 9%, we have to check if there is one return level that equals 9%. But obviously there’s not one. So because this is a discrete random variable and we have the confidence to say there’s no return levels corresponding to 9%. That’s why for the first question, the probability of X equaling 9 percent is 0. So this is the answer for the first question. The second question, what is the probability of return that is less than 9%? So this is a little bit different from the first question, because although there’s no return level, that’s exactly equal to 9 percent, There’s definitely some returns that are below the 9% level. For example, a percent, 6%, 4. So if you remember from the lecture notes, the cumulative density function of 9% equals to the probability of the random variable is less than or equal to 9%. So which translates Because of this, is a discrete random variable. We can actually enumerate other possible values. So this equals to the sum of the probability x is equal to 4 percent plus the probability x equals 26 percent, plus the probability of X equals to 8 percent, which you can find the corresponding probabilities. So for x equals to 4 percent is 0.2 probability and 0.4 plus 0.24 gives you the total probability, which is 0.84. So this is the answer for the second question. The third question is just a little bit trickier than the first two questions. It actually asks you what is the probability that the return levels between 3%? So 3% is less than or equal to the return level and then less than or equal to 7%. So in order to answer this, we know that we can easily compute the probability that X is less than or equal to 7%. All right, but we definitely want to exclude the part that is below 3% return level. So you want to minus the probability that X is less than or equal to 3 percent. So you basically exclude the part that does not belong to this range here, 3%, 7. And again for 7% cumulative attributions level, you can, by looking at a table similar to the second question. We know that 6% 4 return level is below the 7% return level. So you can compute this first part equals to this part, equals to the probability X equals to four plus the probability X equals six. The only two outcomes that have a return level is less than seven. And then you’ll return level that is x below 3%. So by looking at the table here, you’ll find there’s no return that is lower than 3%. So you’ll get a conclusion. Is this value here. This value here goes to 0. So u minus the 0, and it gives you the result equals to 4 percent is 0.26% is 0.4, and this equals 0.6. Okay? So I hope by solving this problem, you have a better understanding on the probability of discrete random variables and also its corresponding cumulative density functions.",
        "In order to accurately and objectively estimate the population parameter, we need some sampling schemes to sample the data. There is typically a trade-off between cost and accuracy. Some sampling schemes are cheaper and easier to administer, whereas others cost more but provide more accurate information.  We will not take much space here to discuss the trade-offs (but you need to be aware of them).",
        "Simple random sampling is the simplest type of sampling scheme. Consider a population of size N and suppose we want to sample n units from this population. The simple random sampling has the following property: to randomly select n number from the data, every number set with a size of n has the same probability of being chosen. Simple random samples are the easiest to understand. Sampling error is defined as the difference between the observed value of a statistic and the quantity it is intended to estimate in order to measure the accuracy of the statistic obtained from the sample.",
        "In the following video, we illustrate a simple random sample example manually by using the Excel sampling function, Rand() and the data analysis add-in (the data is provided in the worksheet named Example 1 found in the Module 3 Examples  Excel template).",
        "So in this example, I’m going to demonstrate how to do a simple random sampling. So we have a population of 40 families with their annual incomes listed here. And I would like to randomly select 10 families and use their income as a sample to represent population parameters. So I’m going to calculate the mean and the median and the standard deviation of both population and sample to compare them. Let’s see how off there. So I’m going to introduce two different methods to do simple random sampling. The first method is by using the Excel rand function. So here we have these 40 different families. So first, I just copy these 40 different families to hear outright. Basically you reproduce everything here. And then under a separate column, what you want to do is type in r a, n, d parentheses. This is a random number generator provided by Excel. It just provides you a random number between 01. So you populate this function to the whole list of families. So the next thing you want to do is because every time you do some operations, this number would change. It will change while you do some operations. So what you want to do is right now you copy the whole list of the random number and you want to paste values. So when you paste values, the values are now fixed. So basically you associate a random number ways one family. And this number has been fixed. The number will not be changed. All right, so remember you want to randomly select 10 different families. So how are you making sure that these 10 families are randomly selected? There are no systematic errors in it. So what you want to do is you can highlight these different columns. And you want to do a sort. And you want to sort by random number. You can either do the value from smallest to largest or you can do the largest to the smallest. It doesn’t matter. So long as you are sorted by the random number. I’ll right click OK. So now the first 10 different families will be the one you are randomly choosing. So this is the first way to do that. And remember, the reason you want to randomly sample from population is you want to get the parameters from the sample. So first of all, in order to compare the statistic from the sample and the population parameters. That’s first because this is the same population. We have only 40. It’s easy for us to calculate the mean and the median and the standard deviation. So mean equals two for the population average of the whole populations. And the mean, if you remember, Excel, has a function called a median. All right, so the standard deviation, because the standard deviation for the whole family is equal to STDEV. And you want to use STDEV dot P. P stands for population. If you remember the degree of freedom we talked about in Module 2. So you’ll want to use that standard deviation STDEV dot py to calculate the population standard deviation. So this gave me the whole population standard deviation. Now, let’s calculate the mean of the first sample we got here. So this equals to the average. So the first ten different family incomes. And you see they are different. The reasons they are different is so obvious because here, this is so-called statistic is the number you get from the sample in order to estimate those population mean. And obviously there are different. But later, when we talk about the sampling error and the confidence interval, you will know that you can use this statistic you got from it from the sample to estimate the population mean. So next, median equals to median of the sample. And again, it’s different from the population median. Finally, the standard deviation is equal to, now, because this is a sample, it’s not a population anymore. So we use STDEV. You can either just type in STDEV. By default, a calculates the sample standard deviation or you can use STDEV dot S. S stands for sample. Calculate the standard deviation. You see the standard deviation from the sample is also different from the population standard deviation. All right, so we’ve finished the first method of getting the simple random sampling. So next, we’re going to use another method to get a simple random sampling. This method is using the data analysis package provided by Excel. So in order to use this package, you need to first install it. So if you click this file and then go to Options, and then you go to Add-ins. As you could see at the bottom here you have Excel Add-ins. So you click Go. And then you want to make sure that this first box is checked Analysis ToolPak. So if you click okay, then it should just take a few seconds for Excel to install it. To see if this pack add-in is properly installed. Click the Data tab. You see on the right hand side here there’s a Data Analysis tab here. This same procedure has been used to install the Excel solver. When you did the portfolio optimization problem, you use solver Add-ins. But here we want to use a data analysis add-in. So next, after this ad and has been installed, you can just click this ad and you see the Data Analysis add-in has a lot of different functions that you can use. We will talk about this data analysis package, will use more of that later on in the course. But here, well, you want to do is select the sampling method. So if you click OK, then first there’s a pop-up window here. The first input is input range. So the input range is where you want to put the population ranges. So this obviously is the income population. If you check this box here labels, you’ll want to include this income. So Excel knows that the income has a label there. Now, right? So let’s just choose the output options are uploaded in the same worksheet. You can check a new worksheet. So you will generate a different worksheet for the output. So for this problem, Let’s just put the output here. You click Okay, see ten different income values are randomly selected. This is done by backstage algorithm provided by Excel to get these 10 different random samples from population. All right, so we will calculate the mean and median. So the standard deviation for this ten different sample also just to compare it with the population parameters. So this is the average. And the median equals the median. And the standard deviation is equal to STDEV.S. See you see the number you get. Also by comparing this simple statistic with population parameters, they’re all different. But you see that when you compute from two different samples, they’re estimated sample statistic. Each time you will get a different sample statistic. When you try to estimate the population parameters. Obviously it will be off. But later on when we talk about sampling error and the confidence interval, you will see how confident you will be by using this statistic.",
        "Now let’s revisit our example and look at the bottom portion of the worksheet named Example 1.  Please follow along with the steps outlined below to set up the @Risk model.",
        "Choose the uncertain variables. In this example, they are the demand (cell H18) and the fixed cost (cell H19).",

        "Set the number of iterations for your simulation. That is how many times you want to choose random samples to calculate the Total Cost. Obviously, the larger number of iterations, the better the results are close to the actual output. Usually, we set this number from 1000 to 5000. In this example, let’s set the number of iterations to 5000. After you click the “Simulate” button, you should see the output as shown in Figure 7.4. You can see that the distribution of the Total Cost with the two uncertain variables is close to a bell-curve  distribution.",
        "Analyze the results. You may click the “Explore->Browse Results” to see the simulation distribution results for the Total Cost. By default, the results show the Confidence Interval of 90% with 5% on the left tail and 5% on the right tail. However, you can change the interval. For example, if you want to see what is the probability that the Total Cost is less than $900, you can type 900 at the top part of the left slider and you will see the probability of the Total cost less than $900. See the screenshot in Figure 7.5. Note that since this is a random sampling process, the resulting probability from your analysis may be different from mine.",

We will discuss the Tornado chart later when we discuss the sensitivity analysis.",
        "You can further click the “fx Function”->”Simulation Result” to get some statistics from the output. For example, you can use “RiskMean” to calculate the mean of the Total Cost output. You can also use “RiskPercentile” to find out the percentiles of the Total Cost. Note that when doing the above, you can leave the “Sim #” option blank since “Sim #” indicates the simulation numbers when you want to repeat the simulation more than once. In this example, we only do simulation once and therefore, we leave the option blank",
        "Sensitivity analysis. It is always a good idea to see which uncertain variables have positive/negative impact on the outputs. We will rely on the Tornado chart to accomplish this job. You can click “Explore->Browse Results” and then click the icon at the bottom that looks like a tornado  and choose “Tornado-Correlation Coefficients”. See Figure 7.7 for reference.",
        "We see that both demand and fixed cost have positive correlation with the Total Cost. However, the demand has a much higher correlation (equal to 100%) with the Total Cost, which means the higher the demand the higher the Total Cost (does this makes sense?).",
        "The steps provided above complete the basics of the Monte Carlo Simulation. For a more detailed introduction, you can refer to the following video.",
        "The model used here to illustrate @Risk’s basic features is of a company that is planning to develop an e-commerce service. There is no marginal cost of providing the service, but a server facility must be constructed which will require an upfront investment for each unit of annual capacity. The unit cost of capacity is assumed to be 80 cents and the revenue per transaction is assumed to be $1. The new service is a fat, expected to be popular for only one year. The transaction demand for the year of business is uncertain, but the company’s best guesses a demand of 2 million transactions.",
        "Therefore, the company must decide how much capacity to build for this single year of business. If it builds more capacity than demand, the extra capacity will be wasted. If it builds less capacity than demand, it will lose potential sales. To get started. Here as a deterministic version of the model, which assumes no uncertainty in transaction demand. Any demand could be entered in the demand cell. But the number used here is the company’s best guess, 2 million. Also, any capacity could be entered in the capacity sell. The current value plans capacity for the best guess of transaction demand. And this is a good choice for the deterministic model. But there is no guarantee that it is best for a model assuming uncertainty and transaction demand, as you will see shortly.",
        "The logic of the model is very simple. Capacity cost is $0.80 times the capacity used. Revenue is a dollar times the smaller capacity and demand. And profit is revenue minus cost. It is important to realize that there is an asymmetry in the model. To see this, I will enter a demand greater than capacity and a demand less than capacity. When demand is greater than capacity, the company receives revenue only on its capacity and the extra demand is lost. So the profit is the same for any demand greater than capacity. However, when demand is less than capacity, the company receives revenue only on its demand and the extra capacity is unused. In this case, profit decreases as demand decreases. This means that the most profit the company can earn with this capacity is $400 thousand. But it could earn a lot less if demand is small. Now, starting with this deterministic model, I’m going to develop an at-risk model that explicitly incorporates uncertainty in transaction demand.",
        "As I go through this demonstration, I will follow the typical steps for developing any at-risk model. Before you can use at risk, you must loaded into memory. This is easy. It can be done with Excel already open, or it can be done with Excel not yet open. In the latter case, opening at risk opens both Excel and at risk. In either case, go to the Windows Start button. Find the Palisade Decision tools group and the list of all programs and select at risk. Of course, you can also have a shortcut to at-risk on your desktop or your taskbar. As you can see, it usually takes a few seconds for at-risk to load. You may get messy just like this one. And eventually you will see an at-risk welcome window. Once you close this window, you will know that at-risk is loaded because you will see this at risk tab for its breadth. It, by the way, you can see that I am using at risk 6 for this video. If you have used only earlier version, you will see a few changes in the basic modeling tools, but nothing dramatic.",
        "To unload at risk from memory, you have two choices. If you close, excel at risk will close as well. Alternatively, you can click the utilities drop-down of the at-risk ribbon and select unload at risk at it. This unloads at risk but keeps Excel open. I won’t actually close it, but here’s how you would do it. Now that at-risk is open, I will walk you through the steps of developing the at-risk e-commerce model. Step one, decide which inputs are uncertain. In this case, I assume that only transaction demand is uncertain. The other inputs, the unit cost of capacity and the revenue per transaction could also be treated as uncertain. But for this beginning application, I will assume that these two inputs are known to be 80 cents and $1 respectively. Step 2, choose a probability distribution for uncertain transaction demand. This step requires you to think carefully about the uncertain transaction demand and choose a probability distribution that correctly encodes your knowledge and beliefs about the uncertainty. For this example, a normal distribution with mean 2 million and standard deviation 500000 is chosen, but others could be chosen. This is a subjective decision and there’s typically no right answer.",
        "To enter this probability distribution in the transaction demand cell, you could enter the formula directly, just like you enter other Excel formulas. But an easier way is to let at-risk help you through it’s defined distributions button. To do this, you first choose the distribution you want, in this case normal, and then enter its parameters, in this case, the mean and standard deviation. As you can see at risks, risk normal function has been entered in the green demands sell. The risk static part is entered automatically for you. Indicates the value 2 million that is shown in this cell when the following setting is toggled the stack. Specifically look at the dice button in the app risk ribbon. This is a toggle. It’s either white or orange. By default, it is toggled to white or static. In this case at rest shows the mean of the distribution and the uncertain cell. So if you press the F9 key to recalculate with new random numbers, nothing happens if it’s toggled to orange or random, which I will do now, the uncertain cell really looks on certain in the sense that if you press the F9 key, you can see many different scenarios. You can decide which setting you prefer. But one advantage to the static setting is that you see the results from the deterministic model. Fortunately, the setting has no effect when you eventually run the simulation. Step 3, choose values for any decision variables. In this model, there is only one decision variable under the company’s control. Transaction capacity. For now, a reasonable value, 2 million will continue to be used, but it will be very later on to find a value with better profit potential. Now is a good time to save your work. Although this isn’t really a step in the at-risk process, you should always remember to save frequently. Step 4, develop the logic of the model with Excel formulas. This is typically where you spend a lot of time. However, this has already been done for you in rows 13 to 15. In fact, the logic is exactly the same as in the deterministic model. However, because the revenue and profit sales depend on the uncertain transaction demand cell, they change when demand changes, as you can see by pressing the F9 key, assuming that the dice button is toggled to random. This is the essence of simulation. When uncertain inputs change, outputs change. So you can see many different scenarios, not just a single best guess scenario. Step five, choose one or more at risk output cells. As you have already seen, if you press the F9 key, you get new outputs, such as new profit values. The trick is to keep track of these values as the model recalculates over and over. This is where you really appreciate the power of that risk. It allows you to designate output cells of interest. Then when the simulation runs for hundreds or even thousands of recalculations at risk keeps track of the values in the designated output cells. And eventually let you see these results in many different ways. To designate any cell as an at-risk output cell, select the cell and click the Add Output Button. At risk will suggest a label for this output, which it uses later in reports. You can change this label if you’d like. For this model, I have designated only one output cell, the profit cell. But in general, you can designate as many as you want. Note that the formula has changed to include risk output and empty parentheses and a plus sign. This is at risks way of indicating that this cell is an at-risk output cell. It has nothing to do with addition. Step 6, change at-risk settings. There are many ever settings you can change from the simulation settings button. However, you typically need to change only one setting, the number of iterations. This is the number of recalculations or repetitions that at-risk generates. You should choose a reasonably large value because you get a more accurate estimate of output distributions with more iterations. The only downside to a large number of iterations is increased computing time. For practical purposes from 1000 to 5000 iterations is generally sufficient. You can change the number of iterations from this dialog, or you can change it directly in the iteration box right here. By the way, I changed one other setting. I chose a fixed random number seed of 123. Although any other number would work, you will typically want to choose a random seed. But I chose a fixed seed so that if I needed to redo parts of this video, I would get the same results each time. If you choose a random seed, you will get different results each time you run the simulation. Step seven, run the simulation. This is the easy part. Just click the Start Simulation button. And although it is not visible here, you will see a progress indicator at the bottom of the screen. Depending on the complexity of your model and the number of iterations you request. The runtime can be a few seconds or considerably longer. Also, depending on which cell is selected and your simulation settings, you might see a distribution being built as the simulation runs. Specifically, depending on whether this button is orange or white. You might see a window showing a histogram being built. You might find this annoying. So if you don’t want to see any simulation results as the simulation is being run, you can toggle this button to white. The simulation results will still be available, but only after the simulation runs. Again, this is a good time to save. However, once you have run an app or a simulation, you are asked whether you want to save at risk simulation results and grafts. Either response is fine. But you should understand the two options. If you respond yes, the simulation results will be saved with the file, and they will be available the next time you open the file. However, this can sometimes add significantly to the size of the file. On the other hand, if you respond know the size of the file will remain unchanged. But you will have to run the simulation again the next time you open the file. Step eight, analyze the resulting output distributions. This is the whole point of the simulation. You want to see how an output such as profit, varies as one or more uncertain inputs. Buret, therefore, at risk provides multiple ways to view output results. I will show the basic possibilities here, and there are variations of these you can explore on your own. The easiest option is to select an output and click the Browse Results button. This shows a histogram of the selected output together with many summary measures on the right. By the way, you might have noticed that many more summary measures are shown in version 6 than in earlier versions. There are also sliders you can move. For example, if you move the left slider to 0 or if you type 0 at the top, you see the fraction of iterations where profit is 0 or less. So with this capacity, the company stands about a 21% chance of losing money. The main takeaway from this histogram is the skewness to the left. This is in spite of the symmetric normal distribution of transaction demand. The most profit the company can make is 400000. And this is a fairly likely outcome that occurs whenever the transaction demand is greater than or equal to capacity. It’s this bar right here. However, the company can also lose a considerable amount of money when transaction demand is low. This chart is quite interactive and at risk provides a lot of options for changing it with its buttons below the chart. You can experiment with these. For example, you can click the third button from the left. Select Copy Graph and then paste it in the Excel. The sliders no longer work, but at least you have a picture of the distribution. But you can also browse the distribution of an uncertain input, such as transaction demand, but this shouldn’t provide any surprises. You already specified a normal distribution for this input. So this is what you see. A second option is to click the summary button. This shows summary measures of all designated outputs on one tab and inputs on another tab. The summary measures include a mini histogram, the mean, the minimum, the maximum, and fifth and 95th percentiles. If you want more summary measures, you can right-click and select columns for table. For example, I will select standard deviation and median. As with Browse Results, there are a number of buttons at the bottom that you can use. Again, they are quite straightforward. For example, you can select the third button from the right. Select copy and then paste it into the worksheet. Although there are better ways to get the results in the worksheet. The results you get from the Browse Results button or summary button are great, but they disappear when you close their windows unless you copy them into Excel as indicated earlier. To get more permanent results, you can click the Excel reports button. However, before I generate a report, you should understand where it goes. By default at risk stores reports in a new workbook, not in the same workbook is your model. If this is not the behavior you like, you can change an at-risk application setting. Do so, click the utilities drop-down and select Application Settings and change place reports in setting to be active workbook. Right here. This setting will stay in place for all future at risk models until you change it again. Back to Excel reports. You can see that there are many options and you can experiment with them. However, the top option, quick reports, is probably sufficient for most of your analyses. This generates a new worksheet. And on the left there are several charts including the histogram you saw earlier, and accumulative probability distribution plus a lot of summary measures to the right. There are times when you might also want output results to be stored in Excel cells. And at-risk allows you to do this with its statistical functions, such as risk mean, risk percentile, and others. If you want to learn about these, or at least see the possibilities, you can click the Insert Function button and select the simulation results group. These are the statistical functions you can use. Each statistical function calculates a summary measure of an output distribution. For example, risk mean applied to profit calculates the average of all profits generated during the simulation. Note that you can enter these functions in a worksheet at any time, but their values will not be meaningful until you run the simulation. Therefore, don’t be surprised if Bs function show unrealistic values or even generate errors, the appropriate values will appear once you run the simulation. Several at-risk statistical functions have already been entered in the model. I painted them white to hide them, but now I’ll paint the black. Here are some examples. The risk mean function returns the average of the prophets. The risk standard deviation function with two Ds returns, the standard deviation of the profits. The risk percentile, was second argument equal to a decimal number from 0 to one, returns the requested percentile of the profits. For example, if the decimal is 0.05, you get the fifth percentile. The risk target function was second argument equal to any potential profit value returns the fraction of profits less than or equal to this type. For example, if the last argument is 0, you get the fraction of profits that are 0 or negative. If you want to greater than fraction, you can subtract risk target from one. For example, here is the fraction of profits greater than 200000. Also note that the fraction of profits greater than 400 thousand is 0 because such profits are impossible with a capacity of 2 million. To other buttons you might want to try are the detailed statistics and simulation buttons. Detailed statistics, simulation data. The details statistics provides about all the summary statistics of the outputs and the uncertain inputs you could ever want. These appear in a separate window, but if you want them in your workbook, you can click the middle button at the bottom and copy them or get a report in Excel. The simulation data button provides data on all uncertain inputs and outputs for each of the iterations you ran. So in this case, there are 5 thousand rows in this table. Again, you can move these into your workbook quite easily if you want that. Step nine, perform sensitivity analysis. Once the simulation model has been developed, it is always a good idea to use it as a tool for sensitivity analysis at risk. Let you run a number of sensitivity analyses, some of which are rather advanced, but I’m going to describe only one type, which is probably the most popular type. This analysis ask the following question. If a model has several uncertain inputs and a specific output of interest, which of these uncertain inputs has the greatest effect on the output? To answer this question at risk provides a tornado chart where the uncertain inputs with the greatest effects have the longest bars and are shown at the top of the chart. The e-commerce model developed so far has only one uncertainty input. So this sensitivity question doesn’t really apply. To make it apply, I will change the model slightly so that the unit cost of capacity and the revenue per transaction are also treated as uncertain inputs. Again, I will use the normal distribution for these inputs, but other distributions could be used. I will also paint them green. This isn’t really necessary, but it is my convention for indicating that they contain at-risk probability distributions. Now, each of these three sources of uncertainty has some effect on profit, but which has the most effect. To see, the simulation can be run for 5 thousand iterations, degenerate the histogram of profit you have seen before. This time, however, each iteration uses different random values of each of the three uncertain inputs. You can now click the Tornado button. You get several choices. Although they all lead to similar results, the correlation item is a good choice. Each bar in this graph shows the correlation between profit and the corresponding uncertain input. As you can see, the largest correlation is with IT transaction demand. The correlation is fairly strong at 0.77. When demand is large, profit tends to be large, but when demand is small, profit tends to be small. The other two uncertain inputs have much smaller correlations with profit. Point 4, 2, and minus 0.28. Of course, the negative correlation between profit and cost of capacity is expected when the cost of capacity increases, profit decreases. But the main takeaway from this chart is the transaction demand has the largest effect on profit. Starting from this tornado chart, you can also see scatterplots of profit versus each of the uncertain inputs. So this is an alternative way of seeing how uncertain inputs are related to profit. There’s the scatter plot between profit and transaction demand as an example. By the way, you can also run the sensitivity analyses directly from the Tornado button in the Results Group, this button right here. Step ten, finding good values of decision variables. One important goal of this E-commerce model is to find a transaction capacity with good profit potential. Which value should the company use? Of course, the company wants to choose a value that has good profit statistics. A large mean, a small standard deviation, a large 95th percentile, and possibly others. This is a difficult choice and there might not be a single value of capacity that works best for all of these goals. However, at risk has a very useful function risk sim table that lets you test different capacities to see their effects on profit. To use this function, you first decide on the capacities you want to test. You can test as many as you’d like. Here, six possibilities will be tested. Then in the blue decision sell, you enter the risk sim table function, not a value where the argument is the list of values you want to test enclosed in curly brackets. Note that at-risk shows the first two beats 1.2 million in the blue cell. But when you run the simulation, it will test all six. Before running the simulation, you’d have to change one simulation set, the number of simulations. You should change this to the number of capacities you want to test, in this case six. Then at-risk will run this many separate simulations, each with a number of iteration specified. 5000. And it will use the same random numbers in each of the six simulations. This latter point is important. It means that one capacity won’t win the contest simply because they’ve got lucky random numbers. Now, I will run the simulation. All of the output reports discussed earlier are available for each of the six simulations. This let you make comparisons. For example, if you use Browse Results, you can click the button with the pound sign to see any of the six profit distributions. Or if you click the summary button, you see summary measures for all six of the simulations. If you produce quick reports from the Excel reports button, you get a separate worksheet for each of the simulations as shown next.",
        "Finally, if you’d like to use the statistical functions in at risk, like risk mean, you can append the last argument to any of them, the index one to six of the simulation. I created the necessary formulas to the right and painted them white to hide them. Now I’ll paint them black. Notice how I made these formulas copyable to the right by making the profit cell absolute and referring to the simulation indexes in row 16. Here’s an example. And I was able to copy that to the right. Which of these capacity should the company use? The decision is still not an easy one, but using capacity equal to mean demand is certainly not a good choice. It has a low mean profit, a fairly large probability of losing money, a relatively small probability of making at least 200 thousand, and a large negative fifth percentile. In most respects, a larger capacity like 2.2 million is even worse. You could easily make an argument for capacity of 1.4 million. It has a high mean, a low probability of losing money, hi, probability of making at least 200000, and a positive fifth percentile. On the downside, it has a relatively low 95th percentile. If you are concerned only with mean profit, you might instead favor a capacity of 1.6 million. In any case, the risk sim table function allows you to make a meaningful comparison across these various capacities. It is a very handy function and at risks arsenal, and you should get used to using it whenever possible.",
