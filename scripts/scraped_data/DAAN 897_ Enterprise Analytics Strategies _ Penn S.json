        "Business executives and managers and analysts have wrestled for many years with the problem understanding how to leverage data to improve business results. For a good part of that time, we’ve used business intelligence, which is an umbrella term describing a family of business analysis techniques ranging from standard reports to highly sophisticated advanced statistics. Recently we’ve heard terms like Big Data and cognitive business. As we look at this closer, we realize that this terminology is still the same thing as what BI (Business Intelligence) has been trying to do all along – looking at and analyzing vast amounts of data that we generate and then look at how we can improve top and bottom lines and be competitive.",
        "So no matter what we call it, Big Data, BI, cognitive business, or even data mining, the challenge that businesses are facing is realizing the value of information that they have.Therefore we need to look at helping business executives, managers and analysts sort through this confusing array of terminology to understand what is real, what is hype and how to leverage this data to improve the top or bottom line or both. We also need to ensure that we have alignment between business strategies and to help manage the complex organizational factors that determine how BI applications are developed and affectively they are adopted within these business processes to increase the top or bottom line or both.So as we should define some of these are the terms:",

        "Klout scores website users based on a set of data mining algorithms and according to the indexes such as if a user has social media accounts or not, his/her number of fans, his/her update frequency, if his/her content is praised by others, his/her number of comments, his/her number forwarding, etc. Klout score social media users with 100 as the standard. Its specific scoring mode is: if the customer has an account on Twitter or another social media website, and their messages can be seen by others, they were to get certain scores.  Based on this, Klout will score you according to the index such as your number of fans, frequency of your information update, Klout scores of your friends and fans, number people who like your things, number replies, number of forwarding etc.",
        "The Klout scoring model has three main factors:",
        "Kred Scoring",
        "The main source of Kred is Twitter and it established a scoring model based on surrounding followers, likes or shares with others. The final score consists of two parts:",
        "Influence score reflects the breadth of the user’s influence and the external connection score reflects the influence depth. The influence score measures the ability of a user to motivate others from 1 to 1000, which depends on the number of the user’s Twitter messages forwarded, the number of new followers and the number of replies of the user.",
        "The main difference between Kred and Klout is that the transparency of Kred is comparatively high which will display how a user gets the final score, even the value of a specific forwarding.",
        "Weibo Data Mining",
        "The user scoring of micro data mainly inspects factors in three aspects:",
        "Influence = activity + spreading capacity + reach",

        "As these examples show, an impact of Big Data is that actions have greater consequences, at a more accelerated pace and direct repercussions for company’s brand quality, customer relationships and revenue.",
        "For both individuals and organizations, there are 4 common elements of what can be considered a framework for Big Data ethics:",
        "What is the relationship between our off-line and our on-line identity?",
        "Who should control access to data?",
        "Who owns data? Can rights to it be transferred? What are the obligations of people who generate and use that data?",
        "How can we determine what data is trustworthy, whether about ourselves, others or anything else? Big Data exponentially increases the amount of information ways we can interact with it. This phenomenon increases the complexity of managing how we are perceived and judged.",
        "Both individuals and organizations have legitimate interests in understanding how data is being handled, which means this has the potential to inform both the benefits Big Data provides and the potential risks from unintended consequences for a truly staggering number of people. The direct impact of failing to understand the complexities and nuance of the relationships between Big Data technologies and the people who use them could lead to dire consequences.",
        "You may be asking why not just any data. Big Data is data too big to be handled by traditional database protocols. In this sense, size is just one aspect of these new technologies. The risk and ethical considerations also come from a few related factors.",
        "Volume, variety and velocity of available information exponentially increases the complexity of information that companies need to manage, and these factors generate questions that haven’t been previously encountered in the course of doing business. The volume which new data is being generated is staggering. We live in an age where the amount of data we expect to be generated is measured in exabytes and zettabytes. By the year 2025, the forecast is that the Internet will exceed the brain capacity of everyone living on the entire planet.",
        "While business innovators are excited about the potential benefits they can create from the design and development of a wide range of new products and services based on Big Data technologies, the size, variety and velocity of information available raises new questions. Some of these questions are about the implications of the acquisition, storage and use of large quantities of data about people’s attributes, behavior, preferences, relationships and locations.",
        "Fundamentally these questions are ethical. They relate to your values and how we play them while creating products and services.Society, government and the legal system have not yet adapted to the coming age of Big Data impacts such as transparency, correlation and aggregation. There was a time when it could be fairly easy to drop ‘off the grid’ and disappear within the continental United States. Today, it would be nearly impossible for a person to do much of anything without generating a data trail that a reasonably knowledgeable and modestly equipped investigator could follow to its end.",
