        "Cash flow is the movement of money that flows in and out of a system and the cash flow diagram is the pictorial depiction of the movement. Money flowing out is normally considered as negative and money coming in is considered as positive cash flow. The cash flow diagram will look opposite if we draw the diagram from the borrower or lender’s point of view. It is easier to solve the problem, if we actually see the cash flow.",
        "An outflow or an investment of $1000 at the beginning of year 1 (at the end of year 0) and an inflow or return of $2000 at the end of year 5 is shown by the following Cash Flow Diagram (CFD).",
        "The initial expenditure of $4000, followed by the receipt of $5000, followed by an expenditure of $3000, followed by a second receipt of $5000, followed by a final expenditure of $2000, followed by a final receipt of $5000 can be shown as below.",
        "In a single investment option the main concern is how much money I will have at the end of the planning horizon, or if I need to have X dollars at what interest rate I should invest.",
        "Cells K4 thru K12 contain the cash flow sequence for end of year 10 thru 18. Cell L4 thru L12 contain the future value of the cash flow. Thus $1000*(1+5%)^(18-10) = $1477.46 and so on. The sum is $15,985.04 and it is the future value of the cash flow. This is the amount of money that will be available for college.",
        "Next, we should calculate the uniform amount that needs to be deposited each year to get the same future value. To accomplish this we could use the payment function available in Excel: =PMT(5%,9,,-15985.04) =$1,449.68.",
        "If a uniform deposit of $1,449.68 was made for 9 years, the same amount will be realized at the end of the planning horizon. We can also use in combination with Goal Seek to get this value. We will start with $1,000 per year and calculate the future value. Then we use Goal Seek to get the correct amount.",
        "The formulas in the Excel spreadsheet area are shown below for further clarification.",
        "If we want to find the uniform deposit for 18 years to obtain the same future value of $15,985.04, this can be easily accomplished using the PMT function =PMT(5%,18,,-15985.04) =$568.21.",
        "Let us look at a problem where a decision has to be made between Vendor A and Vendor B.",
        "Vendor A costs $380,000 and an increase in revenue of $125,000. Vendor B costs $280,000 and an increase in revenue of $95,000. The planning horizon is 4 years and MARR is 10%.",
        "The Excel spreadsheet calculates the future values of Vendor A and Vendor B. The net Cash flow is the sum of the positive and negative cash flows. With cash flow and MARR, the future worth can be calculated. Thus $125,000*(1+10%)^(4-1) = $166,375.00, which is given in cell M6. The future worth of Vendor B is greater than Vendor A and the decision is based on the highest FW. Thus Vendor B should be preferred.",
        "We can also use the incremental analysis to obtain the future worth. However, the results will be the same as the ranking method based on FW",
        "Cash Flow Statement indicates how much revenue, from any sources, the company has taken in over a given time. It is a good gauge of how liquid the company is and how effectively they manage their cash flow. It describes how money moves in and out of the business and is a quick window for deciding whether the company will be able to pay their bills and how liquid they really are. From this you can see how able the company will be to generate cash.",
        "This statement deals only with cash and cash equivalents. This include cash on hand, short-term investments that are less than 3 months, bank accounts and demand deposits. Only highly liquid investments are considered. The International Accounting Standard (IAS 7) requires reporting of these changes in cash and cash equivalents. It is portioned into three main categories, namely cash flow from operations, cash flow from investment, and cash flow from financing. Money coming in is called cash inflow and cash going out of the business is called cash outflow with positive and negative signs, respectively.",
        "Operating Activities:",
        "Operating activities refers to the ability of a company to generate cash, based on its own revenue generating activities as opposed to financing or investing. Operating activities include production, sales and delivery of products or services. Examples of operating activities include: cash from sale of goods or services, royalty fees, commissions, and other revenue such as cash payments to suppliers for material or service, cash for insurance premium, annuities and other policy benefits, and cash payment to employees.",
        "The Apple Inc. cash flow statements are grouped under depreciation, adjustments to net income, changes in accounts receivables, changes in liabilities, changes in inventories and changes in other operating activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from operating activities for Apple is $65.82 billion dollars. This is cash inflow – cash coming into the business.",
        "Investing Activities:",
        "Investing activities are acquisition and disposal of property, land, equipment and other long term assets. It deals with the cash payment. These also includes loans made to suppliers or received from the customers. For Apple Inc., they are grouped under Capital Expenditures, Investments and other cash flows from investing activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from investing activities for Apple is -$45.98 billion dollars. This is cash outflow – cash going out of the business.",
        "Financing Activities:",
        "Financing activities include cash inflows from investors, banks and shareholders as well as the cash outflow to the shareholders as dividends. Examples include: dividend payments; repurchasing company shares; capital loses and repayment of debt. For Apple Inc., they are grouped under Dividends paid, Purchase of stocks, Net borrowing and other cash flows from financing activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from financing activities for Apple is -$20.48 billion dollars. This is cash outflow – cash going out from the business.",
        "Thus, the total cash inflow from operating activities for Apple is $65.82 billion dollars and the cash outflow from investing activities for Apple is -$45.98 billion dollars and the cash outflow from financing activities is -$20.48 billion dollars. In other words, $65.82 billion dollars came into the system and $66.46 billion dollars went out of the system. The change in the cash flow for the year 2016 is a negative $0.66 billion dollars. During the year 2015 the change in the cash flow was positive $7.28 billion. This is due to the fact there was more than a 15 billion cash inflow from the operating activities due to change in liabilities. Debt consolidation, refinancing and other changes in liabilities provide significant cash flow into the system.",
