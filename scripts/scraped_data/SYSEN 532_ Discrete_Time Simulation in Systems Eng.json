        "SYSEN 532: Discrete-Time Simulation in Systems Engineering provides a comprehensive introduction to modeling and simulation for systems engineering. It focuses on the use of stochastic simulation techniques to address the inherent uncertainties in complex systems and instills confidence in stakeholders that proposed solutions will perform as intended upon deployment.",
        "Through a combination of selected readings, interactive lectures, and hands-on activities, the course explores the fundamental concepts, methods, and applications of modeling and simulation in systems engineering. Students will learn to model interconnected heterogeneous systems using hybrid simulation approaches, combining Monte Carlo and discrete event simulations for robust analysis and optimization.",
        "The course begins with an introduction to various types of systems and models, examining sources of randomness and uncertainty, and reviewing foundational principles of computer simulation. Students will gain practical skills in input modeling, experimentation, output analysis, model verification and validation, and simulation-based optimization. Advanced topics include the development and application of hybrid simulations, enabling students to address complex systems engineering challenges.",
        "The primary course deliverable will be a hybrid simulation model addressing a real-world systems engineering problem. Upon completing this course, students will have the knowledge and skills to apply integrated modeling and simulation techniques to design, analyze, and optimize complex systems with confidence.",
        "The scale and cost of typical systems engineering projects mandate that proposed solutions are explored through integrated models and simulations that appropriately account for uncertainties such that stakeholders are confident that the system will work as intended upon deployment.  In this course, we examine the use of stochastic simulation approaches to these integrated models and their application to systems engineering. The course covers fundamental concepts, methods, and applications of modeling and simulation as well as modeling systems of interconnected heterogeneous systems using hybrid simulation. The course begins with an overview of different types of systems and models, sources of randomness and uncertainty, and reviews basic concepts related to computer simulation. Students are given an overview of two types of stochastic simulation, namely Monte Carlo simulation and discrete event simulation. Basic concepts related to input modeling, experimentation, output analysis, model verification and validation, and simulation-based optimization are covered. Students will then learn how to combine the two simulation techniques to develop hybrid simulations.",
        "The course has no formal prerequisites. However, recommended preparation includes basic:",
        "The most important prerequisite of all is your motivation and commitment to learning.",
        "After successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:",
        "E-Book Option: A free online version is available for this textbook at https://textbook.simio.com/SASMAA/index.html",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95 – 100, A- = 90 – 94, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 84 – 86, B- = 80 – 83, C+ = 77 – 79, C = 70 – 76, D = 65 – 69, and F = 65 and below.",
        "There are six weekly assignments (one for each of the weeks 1-6). The assignment for each week will be released at the beginning of the week and must be submitted to the appropriate Canvas assignment before 11:59 PM EST on Sunday in that week for the submission to be considered “on-time” (see the course schedule for exact due dates). Details for assignment are as follows:",
        "There will be one final exam given in Week 7. The exam is released at the beginning of Week 7 and is due at 11:59 PM EST on Sunday of that week. There will be no separate homework assignment for week 7 due to the final exam.",

        "The general steps in a simulation study are summarized in Figure 1.2. These steps and related methods are discussed in detail in future lessons. Figure 1.2 only provides a brief description of each step to give you a general idea about what a simulation project involves:",
        "The approaches presented in this lesson rely on the assumption that the sample data are independent and identically distributed (IID) which requires the following two characteristics:",
        "Data collected from a real system may not be IID.  For example, consecutive waiting times in a queue for customers at a restaurant are NOT INDEPENDENT since a long waiting time for customer ii means it is highly likely that customer i+1i+1 also has a long waiting time in queue. Such observations are said to be correlated.  As another example, suppose that X1,X2, …X1,X2, … represent hourly temperatures in a certain city starting at noon on a particular day. We would not expect these data to be independent, since hourly temperatures close together in time should be positively correlated.",
        "Here, we focus on the “independence” component of the IID requirement and present a simple approach to assess independence of the collected data. In the “Recommended Supplementary Material” for this lesson, you can find a video module that describes a situation related to a non-stationary arrival process with a time-varying arrival rate, where the samples collected from different time intervals may not be identically distributed.",
        "A simple graphical method for assessing correlation in the data is by using the scatter diagram of the observations X1,X2, …,XnX1,X2, …,Xn from a stochastic process. This is essentially a plot of the pairs (Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1 for i=1,2, …, n−1i=1,2, …, n-1. If Xi’sXi’s are independent, one would expect the points (Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1 to be scattered randomly throughout the (Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1 plane. Figure 4.1 provides sample scatter diagrams for independent and correlated data.",
        "The assembly process is a serial production line consisting of four stages (shown in Figure 7.2) with fixed-capacity buffers between the stations (total of 20 buffer slots). The line operates 24/7 and the raw material inventory is managed so that it is guaranteed that there is always raw material available to be processed. The line is also perfectly balanced meaning that the processing time distribution is the same for all four stages and follows an exponential distribution with a mean 10 minutes. Therefore, this production line represents the situation we analyzed in section 4 of Lesson 5. Please go back to that section for a review before you continue.",
        "This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to:",
        "During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.",
        "This lesson introduces you to the principles of discrete-time simulation, a vital tool for analyzing and improving systems with dynamic interactions and uncertainties. You’ll learn how simulations can enhance decision-making in systems engineering.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped to define the steps in a simulation study, analyze uncertainty in systems, and solve queueing problems using discrete-event simulation techniques. This foundational knowledge will prepare you to effectively use simulation tools throughout the course and beyond.",
        "This lesson introduces two primary simulation approaches: Monte Carlo simulation and discrete-event simulation. Discover when and why each method is used to analyze and optimize system performance.",
        "By completing this lesson, you will be able to select the appropriate simulation technique for various systems, analyze performance through discrete-event simulation, and address biases to ensure accurate results.

        "This lesson delves into simulation meta modeling, focusing on regression-based approaches and their role in analyzing and improving simulation models. You’ll also explore how to quantify and address input uncertainty in simulation analysis.",
        "By completing this lesson, you’ll be able to design and evaluate simulation meta models, quantify input uncertainty, and implement custom performance measures, equipping you with advanced tools to tackle complex simulation challenges effectively.",
        "This lesson explores the need for hybrid simulation models to analyze complex integrated systems that cannot be addressed using a single modeling technique. You will learn to combine simulation approaches for more robust analysis and problem-solving.",
        "By completing this lesson, you will be equipped to design and implement hybrid simulation models, combining techniques like discrete-event and Monte Carlo simulation, to tackle complex challenges in integrated systems.",
        "SYSEN 532 equips students with in-demand skills in simulation modeling and analysis, preparing them for roles that require advanced problem-solving capabilities in complex systems. By mastering techniques such as discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo methods, and hybrid simulation frameworks, students can tackle challenges in industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, aerospace, and defense. These industries rely on professionals who can design, optimize, and validate integrated systems using data-driven approaches.",
        "This course enhances career prospects for positions such as systems engineer, simulation analyst, operations research analyst, or industrial engineer. Employers seek individuals with expertise in simulation tools like Simio and a strong foundation in statistical and optimization techniques. The practical and theoretical knowledge gained from SYSEN 532 is directly applicable to job roles that involve analyzing system performance, optimizing operations, and supporting strategic decision-making.",
        "A manufacturing company sought to improve its assembly line operations to increase efficiency and reduce production costs. The current system faced challenges such as bottlenecks at certain workstations, inconsistent product flow, and resource allocation issues. Traditional analytical methods were insufficient to capture the dynamic interactions and variability within the system, leading to suboptimal solutions.",
        "To address this, the company enlisted a systems engineer trained in discrete-time simulation to analyze the assembly line. Using discrete-event simulation techniques, the engineer modeled the entire production process, incorporating key variables such as machine processing times, resource availability, and product demand fluctuations. The simulation revealed critical bottlenecks and identified scenarios where resource allocation could be improved.",
        "The engineer then used simulation-optimization techniques to test various configurations, such as reallocating workers, adjusting machine schedules, and redesigning workflows. A hybrid simulation model combining discrete-event and Monte Carlo methods was employed to assess the impact of uncertainty in product demand and machine reliability. This approach allowed the team to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of proposed changes under different conditions.",
        "As a result, the company implemented an optimized assembly line configuration that reduced bottlenecks, improved throughput, and minimized operational costs. This example highlights the real-world value of discrete-time simulation in systems engineering for solving complex, integrated system challenges.",
