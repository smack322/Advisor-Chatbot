Material is provided on a lesson-by-lesson basis and is presented to you in web pages, Microsoft Word documents (.doc), PowerPoint slides (PPT), or Portable Document Format (PDF) documents. Material that you submit for the course assignments should be submitted as one of these file formats. I will not have the ability to read any other file formats, and I appreciate your cooperation with these details of the course.",
        "Each project team will have at least three meetings with the instructor: during week 2, week 8, and the final week of class. Additional meetings can be scheduled as needed. Participation in these three meetings accounts for roughly 10% of your final grade.",
        "Communication is essential to successful completion of the project and therefore an essential part of this course.",
        "Your class participation will be evaluated by your response and participation in the group discussion boards in each Group Space. I would expect most of your asynchronous communication to be through the Group Space provided in Canvas. Each group also has group file space available in your Canvas Group Space that you’ll want to use, particularly for working on large project files (the size of files you can post to the boards is fairly small). However, you can decide to choose any other communication means that you think will work best for your team (e.g., Whatsapp, Microsoft Teams, …). In such cases, I will come up with an alternative way to assess class participation.",
        "As your project progresses, you will find it necessary to have synchronous virtual meetings with your teammates. You have a few options for communication. The recommended tools are Zoom and the Conferences feature in your Canvas Group Space. Be sure to record your meeting for those members who were unable to attend. Your second option is to hold a conference call. In the past, some groups made conference calls using calling facilities available through one group member’s work place. The third option is to request a Blackboard Collaborate room for your group. Please use the following form to request a meeting room: https://courses.worldcampus.psu.edu/public/roomrequest/index.php.",

        "The objective of Lesson 6 is to analysis the internal capability of the firm.",
        "According to Barney & Hesterly (2010):",
        "“[I]nternal analysis provides a comparative look at a firm’s capabilities. Internal analysis helps a firm to determine if its resources and capabilities are likely sources of competitive advantage and establish strategies that will exploit any sources of competitive advantage. The concepts of resource and capability should be understood in order to understand how to analysis the internal capability. Resource is tangible (factories, products) and intangible (reputation) assets of a firm. Capability is a subset of resources that enable a firm to take full advantage of other resources (marketing skill, cooperative relationships).”",
        "Based on our understanding of resources and capabilities, we can apply internal capability analysis methods such as SWOT, value chain analysis, or the VRIO framework to conduct an engineering management project. Read the detailed descriptions of SWOT analysis and Value Chain Analysis below in order to understand each analysis’ features and objectives.",
        "“Human Resource Management focuses on matching the needs of the business with the needs and development of employees… This includes the skills and knowledge that will be required by the organization both now and in the future. This is an integrated process as it involves looking at every area within an organization” (http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/tarmac/developing-a-human-resource-strategy/).",
        "Dave Ulrich (1996) lists the functions of HR as:",
        "Read the following blogpost that elaborates Ulrich’s HR functions:http://strategic-hcm.blogspot.com/2009/07/dave-ulrich-hr-transformation-book.html",
        "A case study is typically performed in order to explore why a business succeeds or fails. In either case, there are major issues to be identified and overcome. How a business subject handled those issues generally explains its success or failure, but it is also very important to analyze specific problems and potential resolutions along with such issues. The goal of this analytical stage is to systematically and effectively identify major issues surrounding your case in relation to the outcomes of the previous analysis steps (i.e., strategic & functional analyses). Furthermore, this step deals with how to form appropriate strategic responses and actions. It is also necessary to identify possible engineering management solutions through a strategic alternatives review. The table below summarizes the overview of problem identification and solution evaluation methods.",
