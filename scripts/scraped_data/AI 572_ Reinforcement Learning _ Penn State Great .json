        "Supervised learning uses a dataset to train the model. The training dataset has input features and their corresponding output labels. Once the model is trained, the test cases with input features are provided to the model on which the model predicts the output labels.",
        "A number of interesting issues arise when the planning is done on-line while interacting with the environment. Additional information that is gained from the interaction may result in changing the model and also the planning process. Therefore, it is desirable to customize the planning process. This means that there is a need to customize the states or decisions that are currently under consideration or expected in the near future. If both the decision-making and the model-learning are computationally intensive processes, then there is a need for the limited computational resources to be shared equally between them. In order to explore this issue this lesson discusses bout the Dyna-Q, a simple architecture that integrates the major functions needed for an on-line planning agent. All the functions of the Dyna-Q are simple and almost trivial. This lesson will highlight some of the alternative ways of achieving each function and the trade-offs between them.",

        "One real-world example of a reinforcement learning problem can be found in the autonomous vehicle industry. A company developing self-driving cars needed an algorithm to navigate complex urban environments, including recognizing traffic signals, avoiding obstacles, and making decisions at intersections. Initially, the system relied on traditional rule-based approaches, but these proved inadequate for handling dynamic scenarios, such as unpredictable pedestrian behavior or varying traffic conditions. As a result, the self-driving cars struggled to operate reliably in real-world conditions, leading to safety concerns and delays in deployment.",
        "To address this, reinforcement learning (RL) was implemented to train the self-driving system. Using a simulation environment, the RL algorithm was trained to optimize driving decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards for safe and efficient navigation and penalties for collisions or traffic violations. The system learned to adapt to complex situations by simulating millions of driving scenarios, including rare events like sudden lane changes or emergency braking.",
