        "AI 804: The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence is a three-credit course that offers an engaging exploration into the ethical dimensions of AI technologies. This course investigates the profound and diverse ethical challenges arising from the rapid integration of AI into various aspects of human life",
        "Through curated readings and dynamic discussions, the course examines how AI systems challenge existing moral frameworks and highlights the need to redefine or establish new paradigms to address these concerns. Students will grapple with critical issues such as threats to privacy, freedom, and economic justice, as well as broader implications regarding race and gender equality. As AI systems evolve and exhibit higher levels of intelligence, the course delves into pressing questions about their moral agency, responsibilities, and potential rights.",
        "Using a combination of theoretical and practical approaches, this course equips students with the philosophical tools necessary to critically analyze the ethical implications of AI systems. Discussions are grounded in key concepts from ethics and philosophy of mind, supported by a growing body of literature in the field.",
        "Upon completing the course, students will be well-prepared to engage in informed debates, apply ethical reasoning to real-world AI challenges, and contribute meaningfully to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.",
        "AI is the use of machines to do tasks that seem to require human intelligence and cognitive skills (thinking, natural language, inference, decision making etc.) The Ethics of AI is the young branch of applied ethics that seeks to study the far-reaching and diverse ethical issues that arise with the widespread and rapid integration of AI technologies into various aspects of our lives. The challenge is that we are in an uncharted ethical territory with regard to AI: we need to radically adjust our existing ethical paradigms or introduce new ones as we experience and acquire a better grasp of the problems involved in AI-human interaction. A large portion of these issues reflect our concerns about the harm that the use and misuse of AI might cause for humanity. Such issues range from threats to individual privacy and freedom to wider social implications regarding economic justice and race and gender equality. However, as AI systems develop and attain higher levels of intelligence, questions about their moral status become more pressing. If these systems are capable of moral agency, then not only do they have responsibilities towards other moral agents like us, but they also have rights that we should respect in our conduct towards them. This course aims to provide an overview of the nature and extent of the ethical issues arising from AI-human interaction as well as the necessary philosophical background (particularly, in ethics and philosophy of mind) to develop an informed methodology in approaching these issues, with the help of the flourishing literature on the subject.",

        "Ethics of AI is a young subfield of applied ethics, which is the branch of ethics focusing on the study of ethical issues that arise in various venues of life, such as medicine, business, environment, technology, etc.",
        "There are three philosophical branches of ethics as shown in the image below.",
        "Applied ethics involves the application of ethical theories and principles to real-life cases, and thus, requires a theoretical background.",
        "The major portion of philosophical ethics that deals with such theories is called normative ethics. Normative ethics offers different theories aiming to answer substantive questions such as “what is good?”, “what is the right thing to do?”, and “what is a good person?”",
        "Metaethics, yet another field of philosophical ethics, inquires into the very nature of statements that employ predicates such as “good”, “right”, and “bad”.",
        "The primary objective of the first two lessons is to provide you with the necessary theoretical background for a philosophical and systematic approach to the ethical issues specific to the use of AI in our lives.",
        "We will survey the prevalent metaethical positions on the nature of moral qualities and judgments as well as major normative theories of the good. In this first lesson, we will focus on metaethics and two such normative theories: consequentialism and deontology.",
        "Systematic discriminatory practices are generally rooted in biases, which consists of prejudices, stereotypes, and preconceptions about members of a group.",
        "While biases as mental states or beliefs are of interest to various fields of study, including psychology, cognitive science, and epistemology, they are particularly relevant to applied ethics when they inform or influence impactful decisions about individuals. A decision or judgment about a person is biased and thus unfair, if the decision maker was influenced, negatively or positively, by a characteristic of that person (such as race, gender, or sexual orientation) that is irrelevant to the issue in question (for instance, how the person would perform at a job, whether they could pay their loan back, or stay reasonably healthy for the next five years), regardless of whether the decision itself turns out to be accurate or not.",
        "Of course, bias is fundamentally a human phenomenon. The somewhat intuitive expectation would be that delegating important decisions to machines and algorithms that operate on numbers, formalisms, symbols, and lack intentionality (as John Searle insisted, for instance, as we saw in lesson 4) and good or bad values would remove human biases. For such systems would just be neutral about the skin color or gender of the data subjects, which, in turn, would translate into objective and fair outputs.",
        "It is, however, quite naïve to think that technology can remain immune to human injustices. Not only are new algorithms introduced into a society with “old systems of power and privilege”, and historically established race, gender, and class inequalities, but they are also produced within such a social-political context and with the data resulting from or reflecting the existing inequalities.[1]",
        "There are substantial reports and studies revealing that AI-powered machines or algorithms can perpetuate and even deepen biases toward historically marginalized groups.",
        "Take, for instance, gender bias in hiring, which has been a known social phenomenon in job markets. But moving the decision power from humans, who might be gender biased even if implicitly, to AI does not necessarily address the problem. Amazon scrapped an AI recruiting tool that it had been developing once it was realized that the tool was biased against women.[2] Another avenue where AI algorithms are widely used is loan applications. It has been reported that algorithms determining the credit score or creditworthiness of individual applicants are biased against people of color.[3] Propublica revealed that COMPAS (The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), the algorithm assessing the risk of prisoners committing future crimes or reoffending (“predictive recidivism”) and thus informing their parole decisions is biased against African-Americans.[4] Similarly, “predictive policing” algorithms used to decide how much police force to allocate to urban areas are reported to be biased against neighborhoods of color.[5] It has also been shown that facial recognition systems tend to work more accurately for subjects that are male and with lighter skin.[6]",
        "Bias is a preference one has for or against a person or a group, or an idea, a thing, a belief, generally considered to be prejudicial and unfair.",

        "The deontological approaches to privacy regard it as a right. As we saw in lesson 1, deontology or duty ethics construe the rights of individuals as generating duties for others to respect and not violate those rights. For instance, my right to a certain property or land generates the duty for other people not to trespass, unless I permit them to do so. One philosophical challenge with regard to rights is to justify them by offering explanatory answers to questions such as “why is X a right?” or “what makes X a right?”",
        "This challenge applies to the claim that privacy is a right as well. We have a strong moral intuition that privacy matters and that it should be respected by others, but it is not all obvious why that is the case. One might argue that it is a social convention, which can change or lose importance depending on contingent and empirical facts about the era we live in. One might also argue that privacy is just an obsession that we are all psychologically conditioned to have.",

By combining technical knowledge with a deep understanding of ethical principles, this course positions students at the forefront of ensuring AI technologies are designed and deployed responsibly.",
        "One real-world example of an ethical issue in AI can be seen in the hiring process. A multinational corporation implemented an AI-powered recruitment tool designed to screen job applications and identify top candidates. The tool used historical hiring data to learn patterns and preferences. However, the historical data contained biases, as previous hiring practices disproportionately favored certain demographic groups. As a result, the AI system began systematically disadvantaging candidates from underrepresented groups, perpetuating existing inequalities and leading to accusations of discrimination.",
        "To address this issue, an AI ethics specialist was brought in to evaluate the system. They identified the biases in the training data and highlighted the ethical implications of using such a system without proper oversight. Working closely with data scientists and HR professionals, they re-engineered the AI tool to remove biased data and incorporate fairness metrics. Additionally, the company implemented transparency measures, such as explainable AI features, to ensure stakeholders could understand and trust the system’s decisions.",
        "The revised recruitment tool not only improved diversity in hiring but also enhanced the company’s reputation for ethical practices. This example demonstrates the critical importance of addressing ethical considerations in AI, ensuring these technologies are fair, transparent, and aligned with societal values.",
