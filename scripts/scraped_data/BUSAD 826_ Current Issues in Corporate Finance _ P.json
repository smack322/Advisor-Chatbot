        "BUSAD 826: Current Issues in Corporate Finance offers an in-depth exploration of advanced corporate finance concepts and practical financial modeling techniques. The course equips students with essential skills in valuation, financial forecasting, and model-building using tools such as Excel and Monte Carlo simulation software. Topics include capital structure, cost of capital, and creating pro forma financial statements for capital budgeting analysis. Students will engage in hands-on learning, including sensitivity, scenario, and regression analyses, as well as Monte Carlo simulations with @Risk™ (Decision Tools Suite), enabling a robust understanding of risk and decision-making in finance. Designed for finance professionals aiming to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world application, the course includes an intensive residency session and requires intermediate Excel proficiency.",
        "BUSAD 826 covers topics in financial modeling for valuation utilizing advanced corporate finance concepts, such as capital structure and cost of capital, and financial forecasting. The ability to understand and build working financial models is an essential skill in many finance fields, including commercial banking, corporate financial management, investment management, and investment banking. Estimating a company’s current value and projecting its future performance requires reliable and flexible financial models. This course bridges the gap between theory and real-world practice through a step-by-step, hands-on approach to financial modeling using Excel and Monte Carlo simulation software. The course will focus specifically on model building for financial statement projections (pro forma financial statements) and capital budgeting analysis. The modeling exercises in this course will employ a variety of techniques employed in financial model building, such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, regression analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation.",
        "The software for the Monte Carlo simulations will be @Risk™ (Decision Tools Suite), an Excel add-in software. @RiskTM enables the modeling of probability distributions of key assumptions (input variables, such as the sales growth rate) in forecasting, and generates the distribution(s) of output variables relevant to decision-making, such as the value of a project or an enterprise. Monte Carlo simulations will be applied in model building throughout this course and other courses, such as FIN 532 and BUSAD 585 (885).",

Apple’s approach to managing its massive cash reserves, which have reached over $200 billion in recent years, is a textbook example of corporate finance in action. In response to shareholder pressure, Apple has used a combination of stock buybacks, dividend payments, and strategic investments in R&D to balance returning value to shareholders while maintaining the necessary capital for innovation. This example illustrates the importance of financial management decisions in balancing growth opportunities, risk management, and shareholder value. Students in BUSAD 826 can explore these strategies by analyzing Apple’s capital structure, dividend policies, and risk assessments to understand how corporate finance decisions affect long-term business success.",
