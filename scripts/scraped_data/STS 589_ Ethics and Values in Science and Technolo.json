        "STS 589 is a dynamic 3-credit course that delves into the intricate relationships between 20th-century technological advancements and their profound impact on human values. This course offers students a comprehensive exploration of how technological progress shapes and is shaped by social, ethical, and cultural forces. By focusing on the ethical implications and societal consequences of technological change, students will critically engage with the moral dilemmas and challenges posed by innovations in fields ranging from communication to healthcare, and from environmental issues to artificial intelligence.",
        "Through thought-provoking discussions, case studies, and interdisciplinary analysis, STS 589 equips students with the tools to navigate the complexities of technology’s role in society. Whether you are passionate about ethics, technology, or the intersection of both, this course provides invaluable insights into the evolving relationship between humans and technology, preparing you to think critically and ethically in a rapidly changing world.",
        "This course examines the ethical issues within science and engineering from a problem-solving perspective. Fundamental concepts of preventive ethics are considered, as well as professional responsibility within the technical community. Students will learn general organizing principles and specific techniques for framing and analyzing moral problems. These principles and techniques will be applied through case studies and other class exercises within a number of technical contexts, including computing, engineer/manager relationships, and research and testing environments, to name a few.",

        "Ethics has been described as morality and standards of proper conduct. As a matter of fact, ethics and morality terms are used interchangeably. Professionals have a specific role that determines their morality focus while practicing their profession.",
        "In reality, we portray many different roles in life where our focused obligation changes from role to role. Thus, role morality is the obligation associated with a specific role in life. For example, a parent has an obligation not only to not harm a child but to care for that child and help them thrive. Being professional is also an example of role morality.",
        "We know that morality is a little more complicated than just fulfilling the obligation of our profession. It is broken down into three types of morality:",

        "Common morality:",
        "Set of moral ideals shared by most members of a culture or society. Example: Do not steal.",
        "There are three characteristics of common morality:",
        "Personal morality:",
        "Examples: Stem cell research, abortion. Set of one’s own ethical commitments, usually learned at a young age at home or in religious training and may be modified by later reflection.",
        "Professional ethics:",
        "Standards adopted by professionals. Example: specific professional code of ethics. The focus is on the issues that are important to that profession",
        "Often people do not think about the privacy and boundary crossing of technology. Think about all of the databases that contain information about your income, purchasing habits, and political and religious affiliations. More recently with the help of social networking sites information such as your exact GPS location is posted with a simple upload of your favorite photo from your mobile phone. Are computers invading our privacy?",

        "The creative middle way attempts to honor the customs and/or competing moral demands of both the host and home country in some form (as long as they don’t violate fundamental moral considerations). Basically, we are using the methods we know already to determine whether the creative middle way is ethically acceptable.",
        "We need to avoid two extremes: Moral Laxism and Moral Rigorism.",
        "Moral Laxism is where moral principles cannot be strictly applied, we justify in applying them loosely in that moral constraints are almost completely abandoned. A laxist allows solutions to moral problems that involve serious violations of moral standards.",
        "Moral Rigorism is where moral principles must be strictly applied in every situation. This extreme doesn’t involve any violation of moral principles.",

With this foundation, students can drive technological and organizational advancements while upholding their professional and societal responsibilities, enhancing their reputation as ethical leaders in the field.",
        "AI and Automation in Manufacturing: Implementing AI-driven robotics in factories is another example of a project that combines technical expertise with ethical oversight. Students might lead initiatives to enhance manufacturing efficiency while addressing concerns about job displacement. This could involve designing retraining programs for affected workers, ensuring fairness in decision-making algorithms, and adhering to safety and ethical standards throughout the automation process.",
        "Renewable Energy Projects: Renewable energy development offers significant opportunities for graduates, such as leading solar or wind farm projects in underserved regions. These initiatives require balancing cost-efficiency with environmental and societal impacts. Students would navigate challenges like land use disputes, community engagement, and ensuring equitable energy distribution to support sustainable and ethical energy solutions.",
        "Cybersecurity Implementation in Public Systems: Protecting critical public utilities such as water or power grids offers another impactful project opportunity. Graduates would oversee initiatives to enhance cybersecurity, ensuring ethical use of collected data, protecting user privacy, and safeguarding systems against misuse. These projects balance technological advancements with societal trust and safety.",
