Consequently, this course includes team activities and group work that allows for the application of teaming concepts that you learned in the Team Performance course (MBADM 810). You are expected to work in teams effectively and productively to complete all team assignments. Students may not request to work individually on team projects. Any adjustments to team composition are the sole right of the instructor. If you have concerns related to this commitment, please contact your instructor.",
        "The content in this course is challenging. I anticipate that you may have questions as you progress through the readings and assignments. To ensure that your questions are answered, several Zoom sessions have been scheduled to occur throughout the semester. The dates and times of each session are located on the Canvas Syllabus page as well as in the Course Schedule. The Zoom sessions are not mandatory and are not graded, but I encourage you to attend. Recordings of all Zoom sessions will be available for your review in the course Media Gallery.",
        "There is one case study assignment throughout the course of the semester. Read the assigned case study (procure through Harvard Business Review; see the Required Materials section in the Syllabus for the link to HBR). Respond to the question prompts included in the assignment instructions. Keep in mind that these are team-based assignments that include an evaluation of how each team member contributes to the completion of the assignment.",
        "Active and engaged participation by all team members in team-based assignments is important. You are required to contribute to generating ideas for the cases and writing the paper, and you must be accountable to your team on time and effort commitments. As a result, you will be required to complete a peer evaluation for each member of your group at the conclusion of each of the case study discussions.",
        "While the case study is a team-based project, your contributions to your team will be evaluated and used to generate your individual score for the case study assignment. Each evaluation will have the same 4 questions, rated on a scale of 1–7. Contributions will be evaluated on four factors: Cooperation, Participation and Commitment, Idea Generation, and Quality of Written Contributions. This evaluation will be completed by your group members as a peer evaluation. The results of the Peer Evaluation may include an increase or a decrease in your overall grade for this assignment. Students who receive high scores for their contributions to their team may receive up to a 10-point increase in their grade (i.e., “extra credit”). Students who receive lower scores for their contributions will receive a deduction from their grades.",

        "(Similar to the PV formula with the discount rate replaced by the inflation.)",
        "In the real world, the interest rates are different for different maturity. Sometimes a short-term rate may be lower than a longer-term rate. Other times, the opposite may be the case.",
        "The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rate and maturity, where the interest rate refers to the nominal interest rates on default-free, pure discount bond. The pure discount interest rate is the interest rate on a single lump-sum future payment without any risk of default. The present value of a single lump-sum future payment is naturally less than the lump-sum amount, and so it is called discount bond.",
        "The rate of return on a Treasury bill (T-bill) is an example of pure discount interest rate since a T-bill pays a lump-sum amount (face value) at the end of maturity with no payments before the maturity. However, rates of return on Treasury notes (T-note) or bonds (T-bond) are not pure discount interest rates since they pay coupons every 6 months until maturity in addition to the face value at maturity.",
        "Firms need financing for capital expenditures (CAPEX) and working capital. The sources of financing are internally generated cash flows, long-term debt such as bonds, common stocks, and preferred stocks. A brief overview of long-term debt, preferred stocks, and common stocks are described on this page. This section is brief with an expectation that you will learn details of long-term financing topics from studying the assigned reading (Ross 11th ed., Chapter 15).",
        "Long-term debt, such as a long-term bond, has contractual obligations to pay back a stated amount, including interest payments and maturity. Interest payments are treated as a business expense and are tax-deductible. The lenders may force bankruptcy if the borrower defaults on any payments, interest, or principal. The contractual obligations set in indentures include many other restrictions. An indenture is a legal contract specifying all the features of a bond, including maturity date, interest payment dates, interest calculation method, and other features such as callable or convertible, as well as any restrictions imposed on borrowers.",
        "Preferred stocks entitle the holder to a fixed dividend periodically. The fixed dividend must be paid out before dividends to common shareholders, and the shares generally do not carry voting rights.",
        "Some features of preferred stock:",
        "Cumulative preferred stock is a class of preferred stock that requires the corporation to make up any missed payments before resuming common stock dividends. In case of liquidation, preferred shareholders have preference compared to common shareholders. Preferred stock has some features of debt (fixed dividends, like fixed interest on debt), and common equity (potential to appreciate in price).",
        "Common stocks are shares entitling the common shareholders to dividends and voting rights. Dividends vary in amount depending on the financial conditions of the firm. Dividends are not a business expense and firms are not required to pay dividends regularly. Common shareholders have residual claims on firm’s earnings and assets after claims by debt holders and preferred shareholders.",
        "Stock buybacks (share repurchase): Companies often repurchase shares of its own stock using its cash holding, but sometimes financed by borrowing. Stock buyback is another way of returning money to shareholders. This has the effect of changing debt-to-equity ratio (changing capital structure).",
        "There are two important questions on factors that determine the exchange rates.",
        "Spot exchange rates and forward exchange rates are interrelated with domestic and foreign price indices and inflation rates, and domestic and foreign interest rates. Two main theorems connecting these variables and partially answering the two questions are: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Theorem and Interest Rate Parity (IRP) Theorem. This section explains the PPP, and the next section IRP.",
        "The PPP is based on the “law of one price,” meaning that price of an item is the same regardless of the currency used to purchase it.",
        "Suppose pure gold bullion is priced P$ = $1,200 per 1 troy ounce in the U.S. and the spot exchange rate between EUR and USD is S€/$ = € 0.8/$. Then the price of gold in France should be:",

        "Because the U.S. inflation rate is higher, we expect that the dollar will become less valuable. The exchange rate change will be approximately 1.5% – 3% = – 1.5% per year. Over 5 years the exchange rate is expected to fall to:",
