        "Data-Driven Decision Making refers to the practice of basing decisions on the data analysis rather than purely on intuition, experience, and domain knowledge. Data analysis is the process of examining data to find facts, relationships, patterns, insights and/or trends. The overall goal of data analysis is to support better decision-making. Before we discuss in more detail, let us have an overview of basic data mining concepts.",
        "Data is a collection of facts or information, such as numbers, words, text, measurements, observations or descriptions of things. A dataset is a collection or group of related data. Each group and its members have the same set of attributes (variables) as others in the same dataset. Some examples of datasets include:",
        "Data is everywhere. Across a broad range of applications, data is being collected at an unprecedented rate. In the past, decisions were made purely based on guesswork, expert opinions, or on painstakingly constructed models of reality. But nowadays, decisions can be solely based on the data itself. Big Data has the potentiality to revolutionize different aspects of modern society including scientific research, financial services, retail manufacturing, biological and physical sciences, healthcare, transportation, environmental modeling, energy saving, homeland security, and social network analysis.",
        "For instance, consider the field of biological sciences where there is a tradition of creating public repositories and depositing scientific data into these public repositories. The amounts of data that are being produced and deposited into these public repositories are exponential. Once the data are recorded in these repositories by the scientists, the next step is to curate and analyze these data. Thus, emerged the discipline Bioinformatics, which is largely devoted to curating and analyzing the data in the public repositories. In this field the Bioinformaticians, data scientists with knowledge in computation and biological sciences, play a major role. They are largely faced with a daunting task of dealing with a large volume of both structured and unstructured data.",

        "The potentiality of Big Data is unimaginable. In the education sector it is quite evident that the collected data related to the academic performance of every student can be used as a guide for delivering future instruction. It is well-known in the healthcare sector that Information Technology (IT) can reduce the cost of the healthcare while improving its quality by making care more preventive and personalized. With the advent of Big Data and IT, savings in the healthcare sector is estimated to be close to 300 billion dollars in US alone. Big Data can help also in other sectors, such as:",
        "While the potential benefits are real and significant, and some initial success has been achieved, there remain many technical challenges that need to be addressed to completely realize its potential.",
        "But there are also other dimensions to it. In addition to Volume are the dimensions of Variety, Velocity, Variability and complexity.",
        "Volume: This dimension refers to the amount of data; Example– it may be the email you send, Twitter, Facebook, or other social media, or it can just be all the videos, pictures, SMS messages, call records, and data from varied devices and sensors. We have scaled up the data–measuring metrics to terabytes, zettabytes and Yottabytes – they are all humongous figures. Look at Facebook alone; it’s like ~10 billion messages on a day, consolidated across all users. We have ~5 billion likes a day and around ~400 million photographs are uploaded each day.",
        "Velocity: This refers to the data generation speed, or the rate at which data is being generated. In today’s world, where we mentioned that the volume of data has undergone a tremendous surge, this aspect is not lagging. We have loads of data because we are able to generate it so fast. Look at social media; things are circulated in seconds and they become viral, and the insight from social media is analyzed in milliseconds by stock traders, and that can trigger lots of activity in terms of buying or selling.",
        "Variety: This dimension tackles the fact that the data can be unstructured. In the traditional database world, and even before that, we were used to having a very structured form of data that fitted neatly into tables. Today, more than 80% of data is unstructured – quotable examples are photos, video clips, social media updates, data from variety of sensors, voice recordings, and chat conversations.",
        "Veracity: It’s all about validity and correctness of data. How accurate and usable is the data? Not everything out of millions and zillions of data records is corrected, accurate, and referable. That’s what actual veracity is: how trustworthy the data is and what the quality of the data is. Examples of data with veracity include Facebook and Twitter posts with nonstandard acronyms or typos. Big data has brought the ability to run analytics on this kind of data to the table.",
        "Value: This is what the name suggests: the value that the data actually holds. It is unarguably the most important V or dimension of big data. The only motivation for going towards big data for processing super large data sets is to derive some valuable insight from it. In the end, it’s all about cost and benefits.",
        "The rectangular region formed from the intersections of the regions of the circles corresponding to the 3V’s of Big Data namely “Volume”, “Velocity” and “Variety” is coined as Fast Data.",
        "SEM is a form of structural models where there is a very complex relationship between the latent constructs. The latent constructs may influence one another in different ways. The concept related to latent variables and manifest variables were introduced in Lesson 10 when we discussed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).",
        "In this lesson we will look into a model for repeat purchase intention. In this model, the cost of a product is associated with both perception of value and intent to repurchase, while perception of quality relates to both perceived value and satisfaction, which is then associated with repurchase.",
        "To validate this model, we would collect data from the customer using a customer satisfaction ratings survey instrument. In this lesson, we will explore the dataset that contains the responses of 200 customers who took the customer satisfaction rating survey. All the customers who took this survey responded to the 15 satisfaction Items (manifest variables) in the survey, where there were three items for each of the five Factors of Quality, Cost (fair pricing), Value, Customer Satisfaction (CSat), and Repeat purchase intention. Table below lists the 15-item survey instrument for purchase satisfaction, perceived value, and repurchase intent. For each question in the survey, the customer responds on Likert scale score of 1-7, where 1 indicates least and 7 indicates most.",
        "Once we have collected the consumer data from the survey, our goal would be to initially ascertain whether our proposed model of influence — for example, that perception of cost is associated with both perception of value and intent to repurchase. Finally, if the model fits the data well, then we would try to address the following questions:",
        "MB analysis is a data mining technique that has the purpose of finding the optimal combination of products or services and allows marketers to exploit this knowledge to provide recommendations, optimize product placement, or develop marketing programs that take advantage of cross-selling. In short, the idea is to identify which items go well together, and profit from it.",
        "You can think of the results of the analysis as an if…then statement. If a customer buys an airplane ticket, then there is a 46 percent probability that they will buy a hotel room, and if they go on to buy a hotel room, then there is a 33 percent probability that they will rent a car.",
