        "A business process is a set of activities that are performed in coordination in an organizational and technical setting or environment. These activities jointly realize a business goal. A simple example of a business process is an ordering process of the reseller. This business process consists of 5 activities:  Receive Order,  Send Invoice, Receive Payment, Ship Products, and Archive Order.",
        "All these activities can be executed in a sequence, one after another, or one or more activities can be executed in parallel [1].",
        "The Enterprise Application Integration or EAI is the task of uniting the databases and workflows associated with business applications to ensure that the business uses the information consistently and that changes to core business data made by one application are correctly reflected in others. Round the world, EAI face challenges in integrating the complex enterprise applications in a heterogenous information technology landscape. These enterprise applications are often developed independently of each other, and they store data locally. As such they are siloed applications. For example, in an organization, siloed enterprise applications such as the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems all exhibit data heterogeneity. However, these applications need to share data among themselves to successfully enact a business process. Therefore, it becomes necessary to integrate all these enterprise applications. To remedy the data heterogeneity issue and to ensure that all the enterprise applications can be integrated properly it is required to identify a suitable middleware solution. There are several middleware solutions including the point-to-point integration, the message-oriented middleware, the Hub-and-Spoke middleware using message brokers, the workflow management systems, and the Service-oriented architecture (SOA) using the ESB [1].",
        "The process landscape diagram is shown in figure 2. This diagram represents the supplier-customer relationships between the different business functions of an organization. Let’s take a simple example to illustrate the information conveyed through the process landscape diagram. Consider the business function innovation process. The supplier to the innovation process business function are the stakeholders who supply the business function with the market challenges. The innovation process business function now serves as a supplier for the two other business functions namely the product planning process and the product development process by supplying the product innovation and prototype respectively. In other words, the product planning process and the product development process are the customers of the innovation process. The product planning process supplies the product specification to the product development process which in turn supplies the innovative products to the stakeholders (see figure 2). It should be noted here that the product planning process and the marketing process are both the suppliers and the customers of each other suppling the product innovation [1].",

        "Now let us discuss the components of a Typical AIOps Platform shown below in figure 1.  The AIOps platform includes the following components namely, the data layer, the AI layer, and the visualization layer. The data layer continuously observes the IT landscape. In this layer the data is being constantly obtained from different sources of the IT landscape. Data sources can include different monitoring tools, application logs, ITSM tools, etc. The AI layer is like a brain – it uses the data that is collected in the data layer and extracts actionable insights out of it. Different forms of machine learning including anomaly detection, prediction, and correlation are performed in this layer. The visualization layer offers the interface through which different stakeholders can interact with the platform that you can see in figure 1 [2].",
