        "With the flood of data available to businesses, companies are turning to analytics solutions to extract meaning from the huge volumes of data to help improve decision making. Companies are attempting to optimize their efforts to analyze historical data, forecast what might happen in the future. The promise of doing it right and becoming a data driven organization is great. Companies can enjoy huge returns on their investments if they can leverage the big data in to optimizing their supply chain, lowering their operating costs, increase revenues and/or improve their customer service. Analytic options can be categorized at a higher level into three distinct types namely descriptive, predictive and prescriptive. No one type of analytic is better than the another, and in fact, they co-exist with, and complement each other. In order for the business to have a holistic view of the market and compete efficiently they should have a very robust analytic environment which includes [3]:",
        "Descriptive analysis or statistics does exactly what the name implies they “Describe”, or summarize the raw data and make it something that is interpretable by humans. They are analytics that describe the past. The past refers to any point of time that an event has occurred. Descriptive analytics are useful because they allow us to learn from past behaviors, and understand how they might influence the future outcomes. The vast majority of the statistics that we use fall into this category. Usually, the underlying data is a count, or aggregate of a filtered column of data to which the basic math is applied. For all practical purposes, there are an infinite number of these statistics. Descriptive statistics are useful to show things like, total stock in inventory, average dollars spent per customer and Year over year change in sales etc. Use Descriptive Analytics when you need to understand at an aggregate level what is going on in your company, and when you want to summarize and describe different aspects of your business.",
        "Predictive analytics has its roots in the ability to “Predict” what might happen. These analytics are about understanding the future. Predictive analytics provides companies with actionable insights based on data. Predictive analytics provide estimates about the likelihood of a future outcome. It is important to remember that no statistical algorithm can “predict” the future with 100% certainty. Companies use these statistics to forecast what might happen in the future. This is because the foundation of predictive analytics is based on probabilities. These statistics try to take the data that you have, and fill in the missing data with best guesses. They combine historical data found in ERP, CRM, HR and POS systems to identify patterns in the data and apply statistical models and algorithms to capture relationships between various data sets. Companies use Predictive statistics and analytics anytime they want to look into the future. Predictive analytics can be used throughout the organization, from forecasting customer behavior and purchasing patterns to identifying trends in sales activities. One common application most people are familiar with is the use of predictive analytics to produce a credit score. These scores are used by financial services to determine the probability of customers making future credit payments on time. Typical business uses include, understanding how sales might close at the end of the year, predicting what items customers will purchase together, or forecasting inventory levels based upon a myriad of variables. Use Predictive Analytics any time you need to know something about the future, or fill in the information that you do not have.",
        "Predictive analytics is widely used today in many industries such as healthcare, life sciences, insurance, and finance. Predictive analytics employ a combination of scientific methods and techniques such as the following:",
        "Predictive models use known results or the training datasets to develop a model that can be used to predict values for a different or the test data. Modeling provides results in the form of predictions that represent a probability of the target variable (for example, revenue) based on estimated significance from a set of input variables. This is different from descriptive models that help you understand what happened, or diagnostic models that help you understand key relationships and determine why something happened.",
        "There are two types of predictive models:",
        "Classification models i.e. to predict the class membership. For instance, you try to classify whether someone is likely to leave, whether he/she will respond to a solicitation, whether he’s/she’s a good or bad credit risk, etc. Usually, the model results are in the form of 0 or 1, with 1 being the event that is being targeted.",
        "Regression models on the other hand predict a number – for example, how much revenue a customer will generate over the next year or the number of months before a component will fail on a machine. In this lesson, we will focus our readings on Regression models. Classification models will be reviewed in the later lessons.",
        "Regression is one of the most popular method in statistics. Regression analysis estimates relationships among the variables. Intended for continuous data that can be assumed to follow a normal distribution, it finds key patterns in large data sets and is often used to determine how much specific factors, such as the price, influence the movement of an asset. With regression analysis, we want to predict a number, called the response variable. With linear regression, one independent variable is used to explain and/or predict the outcome of the response variable. Multiple regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome (response variable). With logistic regression, unknown variables of a discrete variable are predicted based on known value of other variables. The response variable is categorical, meaning it can assume only a limited number of values. With binary logistic regression, a response variable has only two values such as 0 or 1. In multiple logistic regression, a response variable can have several levels, such as low, medium and high.",
        "In order to review the different types of regression analysis read through the document “7 types of Regression techniques you should know!” from the link https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/",
        "Various statistical, data-mining, and machine-learning algorithms are available for use in your predictive analysis model. You’re in a better position to select an algorithm after you’ve defined the objectives of your model and selected the data you’ll work on. Some of these algorithms were developed to solve specific business problems, enhance existing algorithms, or provide new capabilities — which may make some of them more appropriate for your purposes than others. You can choose from a range of algorithms to address business concerns such as the following:",
        "As time and resources permit, you should run as many algorithms of the appropriate type as you can. Comparing different runs of different algorithms can bring surprising findings about the data or the business intelligence embedded in the data. Doing so gives you more detailed insight into the business problem, and helps you identify which variables within your data have predictive power.",
        "Some predictive analytics projects succeed best by building an ensemble model, a group of models that operate on the same data. An ensemble model uses a predefined mechanism to gather outcomes from all its component models and provide a final outcome for the user.",
        "Models can take various forms — a query, a collection of scenarios, a decision tree, or an advanced mathematical analysis. In addition, certain models work best for certain data and analyses. You can (for example) use classification algorithms that employ decision rules to decide the outcome of a given scenario or transaction, addressing questions like these:",
        "You can use unsupervised clustering algorithms to find what relationships exist within your dataset. You can use these algorithms to find different groupings among your customers, determine what services can be grouped together, or decide for example which products can be upsold.",
        "Regression algorithms can be used to forecast continuous data, such as predicting the trend for a stock movement given its past prices.Data and business objectives aren’t the only factors to consider when you’re selecting an algorithm. The expertise of your data scientists is of tremendous value at this point; picking an algorithm that will get the job done is often a tricky combination of science and art.",
        "The art part comes from experience and proficiency in the business domain, which also plays a critical role in identifying a model that can serve business objectives accurately.",

Once built, new data can be input into the models to predict outcomes. For example, a sales organization can build a cross-selling model of existing customers to predict what other products they’d be most likely to buy from that company.",
            "Machine Learning: Machine learning uses iterative methods and techniques to recognize patterns in large datasets and build models. Applications like recommendation engines for online shopping incorporate machine learning into their software. These engines make product recommendations based on predictions made from past customer buying and browsing behavior."
