However, they faced challenges such as higher sourcing costs for ethically produced coffee and difficulties in implementing a zero-waste system in a high-volume setting.",

They also partnered with local environmental organizations to develop effective waste reduction strategies. This approach ensured the venture aligned closely with customer values and operational realities, making the coffee shop a popular destination. The successful launch and operation of the coffee shop demonstrated the practical application of new venture ideation and feasibility analysis, leading to a business that was both profitable and socially responsible. This example highlights how BUSAD 811 equips students with the skills to ideate, analyze, and implement business ideas that meet market needs and create meaningful impact.",
