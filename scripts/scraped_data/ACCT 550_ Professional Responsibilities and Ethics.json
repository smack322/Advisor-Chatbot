        "Note: Students are reminded that simply meeting the minimal requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content and presentation) will result in a letter grade of “B‐” for that assignment.",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95-100, A- = 90-94, B+ = 87-89, B = 84-86, B- = 80-83, C+ = 77-79, C = 70-76, D = 60-69, F = Below 60",

        "A person of integrity acts out of moral principle by doing what is right.  The professional accountant always places the public interest ahead of one’s own self-interest or the interests of others, including a supervisor or client when faced with an ethical dilemma.   Loyalty to a client never clouds good judgment and ethical decision making.  The ethical responsibility of a CPA is to adhere to the ethics of the accounting profession and not to subordinate professional judgment to others.",
        "What is Ethics?",
        "Ethics is based on accepted standards of behavior.  These standards stem from a variety of sources including religious writing, philosophical thought and the influence of community values. The ethical standards of accounting are influenced by the practices of those in the profession, state laws, board of accountancy rules and the expectations of society.",
        "Norms, Values and the Law:",
        "Ethical decision making follows well-established norms of behavior involving our values, the laws and ethical obligations. The values of the accounting profession are embedded in its code of ethics. The laws create a minimum set of standards. When the facts are unclear and the legal issues are uncertain, an ethical person acts on the basis of established standards of ethical behavior. The Golden Rule is a consistency principle which prescribes that we should treat others the way we want to be treated. In ethical decision making, the process we follow (means) to decide on a course of action is more important than achieving the end goal or results.",
        "The Auditing Standards Board released a standard on audit risk assessment, SAS No. 145 to improve risk assessments and enhance audit quality.  The guidelines are intended to enable auditors to better understand internal controls, address the risk associated with the use of information technology, and determine risks of material misstatement.  The standard includes guidance on maintaining professional skepticism.",
        "The release for SAS No. 145 is available at  AICPA.org.",
        "Section AU-C 315 directs the auditor to perform risk assessment procedures to provide a basis for the identification and assessment of the risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the financial statement level through the understanding of the entity and its environment.  To obtain an understanding, the auditor may consider the industry, regulatory and other external factors, the nature of the entity, the objectives and strategies and related business risks and the measurement and review of the financial performance of the company.",
        "Section AU-C 330 instructs the auditor to design and implement responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the financial statement level.  The assessed risks may affect the types of audit procedures to be performed and their combination.",
        "Management may commit fraudulent financial reporting for being under pressure from sources outside or inside the company to achieve an expected earnings target or financial outcome. Examples of risk factors include competition, rapid changes, decline in customer demand, threat of bankruptcy, negative cash flows, rapid growth and new accounting requirements.",
        "A perceived opportunity to commit fraud may exist if an individual believes internal controls can be overridden. Opportunities to engage in fraudulent financial reporting can arise from significant related party transactions, ability to dominate a certain industry sector, estimates that involve subjective judgments, complex transactions and operations across jurisdictional borders.",
        "If an individual possesses an attitude, character or set of ethical values that allows the individual to knowingly and intentionally commit a dishonest act, the individual may have the ability to rationalize the committing of a fraudulent act.",
        "Financial statements are expected to present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.",
        "AU-C 200: The financial statements are prepared and presented by management with oversight from those charged with governance.",
        "AU-C 700: In order to form an opinion, the auditor needs to obtain a reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.",
        "AS 3101 Reports on Audited Financial Statements: According to the PCAOB Standards, the correction of a material misstatement in previously issued financial statements should be recognized in the auditor’s report by the addition of an explanatory paragraph.  The addition should include a statement that the previously issued financial statements were restated to correct the misstatement in the respective period and a reference to the company’s disclosure of the correction of the misstatement.",

By mastering the principles of ethical leadership and professional judgment, students become invaluable assets to organizations striving for transparency and accountability.",

Mastery of these concepts not only enhances career prospects but also empowers professionals to make meaningful contributions to the field of accounting and beyond.",
        "One real-world example of an ethical accounting challenge can be seen in a mid-sized financial services firm. The company faced allegations of financial misstatement, where executives were suspected of inflating revenue figures to meet investor expectations. The firm’s internal auditors identified discrepancies in the financial records but faced pressure from senior management to overlook these irregularities. This created an ethical dilemma, as the auditors had to choose between adhering to professional standards and risking retaliation or losing their jobs.",
        "To address this, an ethics consultant trained in professional responsibilities and ethical accounting practices, similar to those studied in ACCT 550, was brought in. The consultant reviewed the company’s internal controls, engaged with the audit team, and reinforced the importance of adhering to the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. They implemented a whistleblower policy to protect employees reporting unethical behavior and recommended improvements to the firm’s governance structure. As a result, the firm restated its financials, initiated a culture change promoting ethical leadership, and regained trust from its stakeholders. This example highlights how applying ethical principles in accounting can resolve conflicts, enhance transparency, and uphold public trust.",
