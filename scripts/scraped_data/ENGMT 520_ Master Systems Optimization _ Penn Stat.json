        "ENGMT 520: Master Systems Optimization is a three-credit, seven-week course providing a comprehensive introduction to optimization techniques in systems engineering. This course equips students with the tools and methodologies to identify and implement optimal solutions for complex engineering problems, considering both constrained and unconstrained scenarios",
        "Through selected readings, interactive lectures, and hands-on exercises, the course explores the foundational concepts of optimization, including defining objectives, decision variables, and constraints. Students will delve into optimization methods, such as optimality criteria and search techniques, to solve real-world engineering challenges. A particular emphasis is placed on linear programming and the application of the Simplex algorithm to efficiently handle problems with linear constraints and objectives.",
        "Practical skills will be developed using industry-standard tools like MATLAB’s Optimization Toolbox and Excel Solver. These platforms enable students to solve both theoretical and practical optimization problems, from simple graphical methods for two-variable systems to complex multi-variable, nonlinear problems encountered in modern engineering.",
        "The primary course deliverables include problem-solving exercises using advanced optimization techniques and software, as well as comprehensive projects that integrate theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Upon completing this course, students will be proficient in designing and implementing optimization solutions that address the complexities of systems engineering.",
        "Engineers face problems involving making decisions. They have to pick the “best” from a list of alternatives. This requires a clear definition of the objective and the ability to clearly express it in terms of the decision variables. A thorough understanding of the problem and a detailed description are necessary to define the performance parameters that are needed to specify the objective function. The design variables can be either controllable or uncontrollable. We set the uncontrollable variables to meaningful values and write the objective function in terms of controllable variables. Lastly, we need to define the constraints. They could be the equality or the inequality types. Having clearly defined the optimization task, we solve the problem and determine the design variables that will yield the optimum solution.",
        "Finding the best solution to a problem is a basic human desire. In this process, one may or may not encounter problems with restrictions or constraints which makes them either constrained or unconstrained sets, respectively. There are two basic approaches scientists use to solve these problems: optimality criteria methods and search methods. In the optimality criteria approach, a set of conditions has to be satisfied at the optimal point. In the search technique, a solution set, say a design, is hypothesized and improved upon until an optimum set is found that satisfies any optimality criteria. In this course, we will address both of these methodologies.",
        "When the number of variables is two, graphical methods are possible to obtain the optimum design variables. In practice, engineers face situations that involve hundreds of design variables, and the objective function and the constraint equations are generally nonlinear in nature. With the advent of powerful computers and sophisticated computer programs like Matlab and Excel, it is possible to solve practical problems without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. The optimization toolbox available in Matlab provides a very user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and makes the solution process much easier.",
        "We will start with unconstrained optimization in which there are no constraints and extend the concepts to constrained optimization. The optimality conditions assume that we are at an optimum point and at that point these conditions are to be satisfied. Some of the conditions are necessary and some of the conditions are sufficient. We will discuss situations when they are necessary and sufficient.",
        "Linear Programming problems are a class of problems in which the objective function and all the constraints are linear. This is a very popular and practical approach that is applicable to many real-world problems. The Simplex algorithm developed by George Dantzig in 1947 is a very popular and powerful algorithm for linear programming problems. We will learn the detailed procedure for both the one-phase and the two-phase Simplex algorithm.",
        "The optimization toolbox is available in Matlab and will be used extensively throughout the course. We will also use the solver capabilities in Excel.",
        "*Note: All students are expected to have a working knowledge of Matlab and Excel and an understanding of mathematics at the undergraduate engineering level. The mathematics needed for the course will be quite basic and will be reviewed as needed. You will also be expected to use our online discussion forums, chat rooms, and electronic mail on a regular basis. The most important prerequisite of all, however, is your interest in the course, motivation, and commitment to learning.",

        "Performance maximization and lowering costs are among the reasons for a business to seek optimization. Optimization should not be done as an afterthought but it should be integrated into every phase of the design process. If not done properly it could have a detrimental effect on the performance parameters.Extreme caution should be taken before drastically changing the design variables. We will discuss this in detail throughout this course. First, we will review some of the necessary mathematics.",
        "This procedure involves multiplying the constraints by vivi ; the Lagrange multiplier and adding it to the objective function.",
        "In addition to taking first derivative of the function with respect to the design variables, the procedure involves taking the first derivative with respect to the Lagrange multiplier and set them to zero.",

        "Differentiating L with respect to v, will recover the constraint equations.",
        "Let us illustrate the use of Lagrange mulitplier using the following example.",
        "Minimize f(x)=x12+x22f(x)=x12+x22 subject to h1(x)=2×1+x2−2=0h1(x)=2×1+x2−2=0",
        "The Lagrange function L(x,v)=x12+x22+v(2×1+x2−2)L(x,v)=x12+x22+v(2×1+x2−2)",

        "This results in three equations in 3 unknowns. x1=−v;x2=−v/2;x1=−v; x2=−v/2; and −2v−v/2=2−2v−v/2=2 or v=−4/5v=−4/5 . This leads to x1=4/5×1=4/5 and x2=2/5×2=2/5 and f(x)=(4/5)2+(2/5)2=4/5",
        "In general the objective function can be either maximized or minimized. The constraints can be combinations of greater than, equal, or less than types. The standard form can be assumed in different ways. In this course we take the objective function to be of the minimization type and the constraints are all of the equality type. Further, the design variables are all non-negative. This is convenient and is used to describe the Simplex method which will used to solve the linear programming problems.
