        "SWENG 887: Software Systems Architecture is a three (3) credit course discusses software systems architecture, architectural design principles and patterns, documentation and evaluation of software architectures, and reuse of architectural assets through frameworks and software product lines.",
        "Designing architectures of software-intensive systems can be challenging. The requirements that drive a system’s architecture are often quite different from the requirements that define the functionality of a system. They have a longer-term impact on the system than most functional requirements, some are highly subjective or difficult to articulate, they have non-obvious interactions with each other, and many stakeholders don’t understand the architectural implications of what they need, so they are likely to overlook some of their architecturally significant requirements. The architecture must anticipate change in the functional requirements, in business conditions, in available technologies, in the development organization itself, and so forth. The architecture must also be stabilized while many functional and business requirements are still unstable. Architecturally significant requirements can be difficult to test before the system is operational. They often have cross-cutting impact, making shortcomings difficult to correct after development has progressed, and thus making them high risk. So, another objective of this course is to introduce you to fundamental concepts, techniques and methods used for creating and managing architectures of software intensive systems.",
        "(3 credits) A software architecture is an abstract view of a software system distinct from the details of how such a system is implemented. It plays a significant role in developing software systems that meet quality expectations (such as performance, scalability, availability, maintainability, etc.) of their stakeholders.",
        "This 3-credit course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of software architecture and architectural design principles. They learn about the forces that shape an architecture of a system, how an architecture is created and documented, and how an architecture is evaluated for its fitness to a desired purpose, and how architecture development managed against competing interests of customer value, delivery and cost.",

Please be kind and responsible to your team members by doing your part in a timely manner.",
        "Peer assessment is a valuable tool for me to evaluate the individual contributions of team members. While I will be able to evaluate your individual contributions primarily from observations of your postings and chats, the assessment provides additional information on what might take place outside those meetings. It is important and I urge you to take it seriously. It’s not a popularity contest. It’s a frank, honest assessment. I’m also requiring that you provide an assessment of your own contribution. Again, be honest. I’m not looking for modesty. If you feel you made the most valuable contributions to the group go ahead and evaluate it that way.",

        "Unit/Lesson Objectives:",
        "Empowering Readings:",
        "Mastering software engineering architecture offers multifaceted benefits that extend beyond the mere construction of software systems. At its core, a robust understanding of architectural principles enhances the design and integration of scalable, resilient, and adaptable systems. Such systems cater to current requirements while being flexible to evolving business and technological landscapes. From an academic perspective, proficiency in software architecture instills a holistic view of systems, fostering a deep comprehension of the trade-offs associated with design decisions. This capability is essential for the critical evaluation of contemporary architectures and the innovative creation of novel structures. Additionally, mastery in this domain promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, as architectural considerations often intersect with fields such as human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and data science. Consequently, an adeptness in software engineering architecture not only augments the quality and longevity of software solutions but also cultivates a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving.",
        "Software engineering architecture is a crucial skill, particularly evident when examining the evolution of modern digital platforms like streaming services. Consider Netflix, which began as a DVD rental service but pivoted to a global streaming behemoth. The architectural decisions behind this platform have played an instrumental role in its success. As Netflix expanded its user base and diversified its content offerings, its initial monolithic architecture was not scalable enough to accommodate the exponential growth in traffic and the diverse range of devices accessing the service. Leveraging the principles of software engineering architecture, Netflix transitioned to a microservices-based architecture. This allowed different components of the platform, such as recommendation engines, user profiles, and content delivery systems, to evolve, scale, and fail independently without affecting the entire ecosystem. Such an architectural overhaul ensured that millions of users could simultaneously stream content without latency, glitches, or outages.",
        "Another real-world example is the development and operation of smart cities. As urban areas worldwide integrate technology to improve infrastructure, transportation, energy management, and public services, software engineering architecture becomes pivotal. The complex interplay of sensors, databases, user interfaces, and control systems demands an architectural framework that is both robust and flexible. For instance, in a smart traffic management system, real-time data from traffic lights, cameras, and vehicle sensors must be processed efficiently to control traffic flow, predict congestions, and manage emergencies. Mastery in software engineering architecture ensures that such systems can not only handle massive concurrent data streams but also integrate with other systems like public transportation or emergency services. The coherence and efficiency of these integrated systems are a direct reflection of the architectural expertise underpinning their design and operation.",
