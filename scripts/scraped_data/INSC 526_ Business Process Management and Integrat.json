        "The BPM methodology captures all the phases that are required to develop business process applications. The BPM methodology demonstrated in Figure 2.1 takes a project-oriented view for developing business process applications.",
        "The different phases in the BPM methodology include:",
        "Select the information buttons  in the image below for a description of these phases.",
        "Try to define these terms in your own words before turning the card to see the correct answer.",
        "In the BPMN, control flow is also called as sequence flow which is represented as an arrow between the flow objects such as the events, activities and the gateways. There are different types of sequence flows, namely normal flow, exception flow, sequence flow induced by link events, and adhoc flow.",
        "A normal flow of a business process represents an expected and desired behavior of the process. It starts in the start event and continues through a set of flow objects until it reaches the end event. Exceptional situations are reached by exception flow. With respect to the process enactment, the exception flow does not define the desired flow of the process, but exceptional situations. Exception flow is created by intermediate events attached to the boundary of an activity. Each intermediate event of this kind is associated with an event context, used to determine whether the event will occur. The intermediate event will spawn only the exception flow if the activity that the intermediate event is attached to is still active when the event occurs.",
        "In figure 8.7, a business process involving a brainstorming session is shown. Once the room for the brainstorming session is reserved, the brainstorming session starts. This activity provides the event context for the intermediate timer event that is attached to its boundary. This session is limited to three hours. When the brainstorming session activity starts, the timer is started. When three hours has elapsed, an intermediate event is generated. If at this point in time the brainstorming activity is still active, an exception is raised, the brainstorming activity is completed, and the process continues with the consolidation of results activity. If the brainstorming sessions last less than three hours, the result consolidation activity is conducted as part of the normal sequence flow. In this case, the event context is no longer present when the intermediate timer event occurs (see figure 7).",
