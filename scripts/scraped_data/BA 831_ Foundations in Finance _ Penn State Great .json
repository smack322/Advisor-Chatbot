        "Corporate finance deals with the management of a company’s finances.  When talking about a company, we restrict our attention to publicly-traded corporations. There are three major decisions in corporate finance:",
        "An easy way to describe these decisions is to look at a representative (and simplified) balance sheet below.",
        "Capital investment decisions deal with the investments in long-lived assets (bottom left-hand side of the balance sheet labeled fixed assets).  Capital budgeting is the term used to describe the process of making and managing such investments.",
        "Financing decisions deal with the middle and bottom parts of the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  This part of the balance sheet is concerned with the firm’s capital structure, namely the proportions of interest-bearing debt and equity used in the firm.",
        "The management of short-term liquidity or operating cash flows deals with the upper left-hand and upper right-hand sides of the balance sheet.  In corporate finance, the management of short-term operating cash flows is associated with the firm’s net working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities.",
        "To provide a real-world perspective, below is Home Depot’s 2019 fiscal-year balance sheet taken from its 2019 Annual Report  (See note)",
        "The job of a financial manager is to manage the three activities related to capital budgeting, capital structure, and short-term operating cash flows.  The process to manage these activities can be described by the following figure.",
        "Imagine that the financial manager sits in the middle of the yellow and blue boxes.  The firm starts by raising capital in the financial market (A) in the form of debt and equity.  The capital raised in the form of debt and equity is reported on the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  The company then invests that capital in productive assets (B) classified as current assets and fixed assets on the left-hand side of the firm’s balance sheet.  At the end of the operating period, the firm records its revenue, costs and expenses in its income statement and reports its cash flows in the statement of cash flows (C).  Some of the cash generated goes to the government in the form of taxes (D), some is retained and plowed back into the business (E), and some goes to repayment of debt and dividend payments (F).",
        "Conducting the above activities requires the financial manager to make decisions that create value for the firm.  Value is created when the firm’s activity generates returns on capital that exceeds its costs.  As you progress through the Master of Finance program, the definition of value creation (or destruction) will be operationalized in subsequent courses such as BUSAD826.  When you reach the capstone course (BUSAD585), you should be able to identify firms that create or destroy value and understand the sources of value creation or destruction.",
        "For those with a business background, the earlier definition of value creation sounds like a measure of profit (or profitability) in accounting.  While related, it goes beyond an accounting measure.  In finance, cash flows are important.  Because firms operate over multiple periods, the timing of revenue generation (and hence, the recognition of revenue and accounting profit) is not necessarily going to coincide with the timing of cash flows.  Moreover, the magnitude of accounting profit is not the same as that of cash flows.  Complicating matters further, the amount and timing of cash flows are not known with certainty.  As such, financial managers need to manage risk as well.",
        "Financial decision making relies on the availability of data. Statistical methods provide powerful tools to analyze data and draw conclusions from them.   To make sense of financial data, we need the help of statistics.",
        "Statistical methods include descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.",
        "In this section, we will describe tools from descriptive statistics to help us understand the topic in the next section.",
        "In statistics, it is important to know the difference between populations and samples.  A population is a group of all items of interest to the statisticians, while a sample is a subset of the population.  A descriptive measure of a population is called a parameter, while a descriptive measure of a sample is called a statistic.  In practice, it can be impractical and costly to get information about a population.  That’s why a sample is collected to characterize the population.  For example, collecting the stock price performance of all large-capitalization stocks in the US (population) would be costly in terms of effort and cost, not to mention the potential error with data collection.  Instead, we could use the performance of the S&P 500 index (sample) as a proxy.",
        "Descriptive Statistics Tools",
        "Select each heading below to read more about these descriptive statistics tools.",
        "One useful tool to visually describe historical data, e.g., monthly returns of Costco over the last 5 years, is frequency table and its corresponding histogram. Let’s say you have downloaded the monthly returns data for Costco over the last 5 years. Constructing the frequency table and histogram is easily done in Excel. You are strongly encouraged to check Youtube videos, read Excel’s help menu, or do a Google search for steps to construct a frequency table and histogram. Below is the distribution and histogram of Costco’s monthly returns from August 2015 through July 2020.",
        "As the histogram shows, the most common monthly returns for Costco lie between 4.01% and 6.63% with 13 observations out of 60.",
        "While visual description of data above is useful, we often want to better quantify the characteristics of data. To do so, we calculate the central tendency of the data. The most frequently used central tendency measure is the mean (usually called the average). Other measures include the median and mode. (Note about other measures)",
        "The mean of a variable of interest in a data set is computed by adding all the values associated with that particular variable in the data set divided by the number of values for that variable in the data set.",
        "The population mean is computed as μ = Σi=1N Xi / N where N is the number of observations in the entire population and Xi is the ith observation.",
        "While the sample mean is calculated as ̅X = Σi=1n Xi / n where n is the number of observations in the sample.",
        "The median is the middle value of a variable of interest in the data set.  The median is found by locating the middle value of observations in a data set that have been sorted into ascending (or descending) order.",
        "In an odd-numbered sample of n items, the median occupies the (n + 1)/2 position.",
        "In an even-numbered sample, the median is defined as the average value of items occupying the n/2 and (n + 2)/2 positions (namely, the average of the two middle items).",
        "The mode is the most frequently occurring value for a variable of interest in a data set.  A distribution can have more than one mode or even no mode.  A distribution with two modes is called bimodal; a distribution with three modes is called trimodal.",
        "Note: Like the mean, we can distinguish between a population median and a sample median as well as between a population mode and a sample mode.  The term median and mode are used here without qualification in the interest of brevity.",
        "Below is an example of computing the mean, median, and mode in Excel.  There are 17 observations in the hypothetical sample data set, identified in column A.  Column B contains the variable of interest.",
        "In practice, median is sometimes a better measure of central tendency than the mean because the median is more robust against outliers and when the distribution is skewed.",
        "To better quantify the characteristics of data, it is also useful to have measures of dispersion. Dispersion is defined as variability around the central tendency.  Common measures of dispersion are range, mean absolute deviation, variance, and standard deviation. All of these are measures of absolute dispersion, namely, the amount of variability without comparison to a reference point or benchmark.",
        "Range is the simplest measure of dispersion, and is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set (Note about range).   Rather than using only the maximum and minimum values in the data set to measure dispersion, we can use all observations. In this case, we can measure the deviation from the mean for each observation. Then, we could compute the arithmetic mean of the deviation from the mean. However, we have a problem: the deviation from the mean always sum to 0, so the average of the deviations from the mean would be 0 as well.This result occurs because the negative deviations cancel out the positive deviations. To address this issue, we take the absolute deviation from the mean for each observation in the data set. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a sample is computed as:",
        "MAD = Σi=1n |Xi – ̅X| / n         Equation (4)",
        "̅X is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample. Below is an example of range and mean absolute deviation in Excel.",
        "Cells G6-G8 show the calculations of minimum value, maximum value, and range.  Column C shows the deviation from the mean for each observation.  Note that the average of deviation from the mean (cell C22) is 0 because the sum of values in cells C4 to C20 is 0.  Column D contains the absolute deviation from the mean.  Note that each entry in cells D4 to D20 takes the absolute value of the corresponding entries in cells C4 to C20.  As shown in cell D22, the MAD is 4.47059.",
        "Instead of taking the absolute value of deviations from the mean, we can take the square of the deviations from the mean to measure dispersion.  The variance and standard deviation, which are based on squaring the deviations from the mean, are the two most commonly used measure of dispersion.  The variance is defined as the average of the squared deviations around the mean.  Standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance.  In finance, variance and standard deviation are the most practical and widely used measure of dispersion, often used to assess the level of risk in an investment.  The greater the standard deviation of investment returns, the higher the risk of the investment.",
        "Like the mean, we can distinguish population and sample variance and standard deviation.  The formulas are given below.",
        "Population variance: σ2 = Σi=1N ( Xi – μ )2 / N   \nSample variance: s2 = Σi=1n ( Xi – ̅X )2 / (n – 1)  \nEquation (5)",
        "where μ is the population mean, ̅X is the sample mean, N is the population size, and n is the sample size.",
        "Note from equations (5) and (6) that the variance and standard deviation are greater when the squared deviations from the mean are greater (namely, more variability around the mean).  Because variance is expressed in squared units of measurement, it is often more appealing to use the standard deviation, which is measured in the original unit of measurement.",
        "It is also important to note that the denominator in the sample variance or standard deviation calculation is n-1, not n.  The quantity n-1 is known as the degrees of freedom in estimating the population variance.  To calculate sample variance or standard deviation in a sample data set with n observations, we must first compute the sample mean.  Once the sample mean has been computed, there are only n-1 independent deviations from it.",
        "Using the previous hypothetical sample data set, the calculations of sample variance and standard deviation are given below.",
        "Sample variance is shown in cells D22 and D23.  Cell D22 uses equation (5) for sample variance, while cell D23 uses Excel’s built-in sample variance formula (VAR.S).  As shown, the results are identical.  Similarly, the sample standard deviation calculation in cell D25 uses equation (6) for sample standard deviation.  Cell D26 shows the calculation of sample standard deviation using Excel’s built-in function (STDEV.S).  The results are identical.",
        "The MM Dividend Irrelevance Theory is useful as a benchmark case to think about factors that are likely to matter in the real world.  Let’s now consider a few real-world market imperfections: (a) personal taxes, (b) agency costs, and (c) asymmetric information.",
        "Select each header below for information",
        "In the U.S., tax rate on dividend income is higher than it is on capital gains.  For individual investors, the preferential tax treatment of capitals gains should affect their preference for dividend payments versus stock repurchases.  For most individuals, capital gains are not taxed until they are realized.  Moreover, the tax rate applied to realized long-term capital gains has been generally lower than the tax rate on dividend income.  As rational investors can time the realization of capital gains, it’s reasonable to expect them to be averse to dividend payments and prefer share repurchases for tax reasons.",
        "However, some rational investors may be in a high tax-bracket group, while others in a low tax-bracket group.  Investors in the low tax-bracket are likely to prefer low- to medium-payout stocks, while those in the high tax-bracket are likely to prefer zero- to low-payout stocks.  In addition, there are tax-free institutions and corporations that may have certain preferences regarding dividend payout.  For example, although pension funds are exempt from taxes on dividends and capital gains, they may prefer dividends.  Corporations can exclude at least 70% of their dividend income but cannot exclude any capital gains.  So, corporations are likely to prefer high dividend-paying stocks even if they have no need for dividend income.",
        "Managers are hired to serve the best interest of the company’s shareholders.  When there is a conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, managers may make a decision in the shareholders’ best interest.",
        "In other situations, however, managers may pursue their own selfish interest at the expense of shareholders.  For example, managers may find it easier to pursue their selfish goals when the company has a lot of free cash flow.  Scholars have suggested that the board of directors can use dividend policy to reduce the agency costs of free cash flow.  By using the surplus cash flow (in excess of that needed to fund positive NPV projects) to pay dividends or buy back shares, the management’s ability to waste corporate resources can be restricted.",
        "Empirical studies have documented positive stock price reaction in response to dividend increases and negative stock price reaction in response to dividend cuts.  Surveys have also reported that management is reluctant to cut dividends and has a priority to maintain a consistent dividend policy.  Since managers have better knowledge about the company than do outsiders, rational investors will reason that dividend increases are good news and dividend cuts are bad news.  Given the management priority to maintain consistent dividend policy and reluctance to cut dividends, it’s reasonable to argue that management will not increase the level of dividends if it is not confident that the new dividend level can be maintained in the future.",
        "Hence, the increase in dividends is interpreted as a signal of the management’s optimism in the company’s future prospects.  A dividend reduction signals management’s beliefs that bad times are coming.",
        "The objective of this course is to provide foundational tools and principles to value financial instruments, assess long-term investments, and understand the relationship between risk and return.
