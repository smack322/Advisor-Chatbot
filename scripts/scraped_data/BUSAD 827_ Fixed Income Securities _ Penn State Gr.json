        "The price of any financial instrument should be the same as the sum of present values of all future cash flows that you expect to receive from holding the financial instrument to its maturity.",
        "Therefore, to determine the price of any financial instrument, it is required to have an estimate of (i) the expected cash flows, and (ii) the appropriate required yield to be used to calculate present values of the expected cash flows. We will discuss how to measure the appropriate required yield in Chapter 3. Here we will first focus on the expected cash flows.",

        "Alpha enters with BCB into a 10-year plain vanilla interest swap contract with a six-month settlement period (therefore, the reset frequency is every 6 month) and the notional principal amount (NP) of $20 million. Under the contract, Alpha agrees to receive the floating-rate payments (3-month LIBOR * NP of $20 million) by paying the fixed-rate payment (5% p.a. * NP of $20 million) on every 6 months for the next 10 years.",
        "Combined with the interest rate swap, Alpha successfully converts the net interest payment on the BCB loan from variable rate (3-mo LIBOR plus 2%) to a fixed rate at 7% as shown below:",

        "This lesson introduces the key factors affecting yield spreads between bonds, with a particular focus on maturity and its role in determining interest rate patterns.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you will have developed a deep understanding of the term structure of interest rates, the construction of yield curves, and the importance of theoretical spot rates in bond pricing, preparing you to navigate yield dynamics confidently.",

        "By the end of this lesson, you will have a comprehensive understanding of interest-rate swaps, including their pricing, valuation, and practical applications, equipping you to use these tools effectively in real-world financial settings.",
        "BUSAD 827 equips students with advanced knowledge and practical skills in fixed-income securities, derivatives, and portfolio management. This course is designed to prepare individuals for high-impact roles in investment management, risk analysis, and financial consulting by teaching techniques for evaluating and pricing complex financial instruments such as bonds, swaps, and interest-rate derivatives. Graduates of this course gain a competitive edge in the financial sector, as they are equipped to assess risk, develop effective investment strategies, and manage portfolios with precision.",
        "Professionals who complete BADM 827 are well-positioned for roles such as Fixed-Income Analyst, Portfolio Manager, Financial Risk Manager, or Derivatives Trader. This expertise is highly sought after by employers in investment banks, asset management firms, and financial consulting organizations. Mastery of the concepts taught in this course can significantly enhance career prospects in the competitive financial services industry.",
        "One real-world example related to the concepts taught in BADM 827: Advanced Fixed-Income Securities Analysis can be found in the 2008 financial crisis. During this period, many institutional investors and banks held complex financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in their portfolios. These instruments were structured with embedded options and other features that made their valuation challenging. Many institutions relied on traditional yield spread measures without fully understanding the risks or applying more sophisticated tools, such as option-adjusted spreads (OAS) or static spreads, to assess their true value and risk exposure.",
        "As the housing market collapsed and interest rates fluctuated, the lack of accurate pricing and risk management techniques led to significant losses. For example, large financial institutions faced liquidity issues because they underestimated the sensitivity of these securities to market changes. To address this, some firms turned to advanced valuation techniques, including the use of binomial interest-rate trees and OAS, to reassess their portfolios and make more informed decisions about restructuring their holdings.",
        "This situation highlights the importance of mastering fixed-income valuation and risk management techniques, such as those taught in BADM 827. By using these advanced methodologies, financial professionals can better evaluate complex instruments, anticipate market risks, and develop strategies to protect institutional portfolios. These skills not only prevent financial losses but also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and foster long-term stability in the financial markets.",
