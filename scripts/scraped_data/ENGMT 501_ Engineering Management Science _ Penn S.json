        "ENGMT 501: Engineering Management Science is a three-credit course offering a foundational approach to quantitative decision-making within engineering management. This course equips students with powerful modeling tools to analyze and resolve complex, data-driven problems that engineering managers face daily. Through a combination of structured activities and hands-on spreadsheet modeling, students will explore methods including linear and nonlinear programming, forecasting, and simulation to address critical management issues such as production planning, inventory control, and project scheduling.",
        "Students will gain proficiency in Program Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) and Critical Path Methods (CPM) to manage project timelines and costs effectively. Additionally, they’ll learn how to extract actionable insights from data, improve forecasting accuracy, and optimize inventory. This first course in the Engineering Management Program is a comprehensive introduction designed to build a strong foundation for advanced decision-making tools essential for today’s engineering leaders.",
        "By the end of this course, students will have developed the skills needed to use mathematical models to navigate and solve real-world engineering management challenges, preparing them to lead with confidence and precision in complex environments.",
        "This course is designed to provide students with insights into the use of modeling tools using spreadsheets to analyze quantitative problems engineering managers face on a daily basis. These tools include linear and nonlinear programming, forecasting, and simulation techniques to solve problems where randomness is a critical factor such as in production planning and inventory control. Program Evaluation Review Techniques (PERT) and Critical Path Methods (CPM) will also be used to schedule and control project costs.",

        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 94 – 100, A- = 90 – 93, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 83 – 86, B- = 80 – 82, C+ = 76 – 79, C = 70 – 75, D = 60 – 69, and F = Below 60.",

        "Break-even analysis is a very simple analysis that is very important to economists and financiers. A business wants to know the minimum amount they have to sell so that they will not lose money. To understand this, one needs to know the total revenue and the total costs. The volume at which the total costs equal the total revenue is the break-even point. Above that point, the company will make a profit and below that the company will lose money. The following variables need to be understood:",
        "In practice we often encounter situations where some of the variables have to be integers and others can be fractional; they are classified as mixed integer programming. The integer requirement is easily satisfied by constraining either all the variables or the required variables to be integer in the constraint window as shown below:",
        "A subset of integer programming problems is Binary Integer Programming (BIP). The decisions to be made are of the “Yes or No” kind. By setting 1 for Yes and 0 for No, these problems are easily handled using Excel Solver. There are many applications of BIP, ranging from the choice to build a factory in Los Angeles or San Francisco, picking appropriate projects in capital budgeting, location of warehouses, assigning a crew to a particular flight and loading an item into a container or not.",
        "We now calculate the early start time and early finish time for each activity. The earliest start time of an activity is how soon an activity can be started. The earliest finish time is the early start time plus the duration of that activity.",
        "We can define the early start time of an activity as equal to the largest of the earliest finish times of its immediate predecessors.",
        "It took 8 weeks for the completion of the project. The early start and early finish times for the entire project are shown in the following figure.",
        "Now we need to calculate the latest start and latest finish time for all the activities. To do this we move from right to left instead of left to right, as we did in the calculation of early start and early finish calculations. This is known as a backward sweep.",
        "Latest finish is the time at which an activity has to finish. By subtracting the duration from the latest finish, we can get the latest start.",
        "Look at all the end activities – D, E, J and K. These activities are not in the predecessor list. As long as one completes these activities in 8 weeks there will be no penalty to the completion of the project. We calculate the Latest Start = Latest Finish – Duration.",
        "Activity D: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 2 Weeks; Latest Start = 6 Weeks:Activity E: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 3 Weeks; Latest Start = 5 Weeks:Activity J: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 3 Weeks; Latest Start = 5 Weeks:Activity K: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 4 Weeks; Latest Start = 4 Weeks:",
        "Now look at Activity I. Its duration is 1 week. This has to be completed before J starts. However, the latest start on J is 5 Weeks. That means activity J has to start at week 5. It follows then that the Latest Finish time on I is 5 weeks, and the latest start on activity I is 5 – 1 or 4 weeks.",
        "Now look at Activity H. Duration is 1 week. This has to be completed before activity I starts. But the latest start on I is 4 Weeks. That means activity J has to start at week 4. It follows then that the Latest Finish time on H is 4 weeks, and the latest start on activity H is 4 – 1 or 3 weeks.",
        "Now look at activity G. This activity has to be completed before activity H begins. From above, we know activity H has to start on week 3. That means that G has to finish by week 3. The duration of activity G is 1 week and therefore the latest start on activity G is week 2.",
        "Now look at activity F. This activity has to be completed before activity K begins. From above, we know activity K has to start on week 4. That means that F has to finish by week 4. The duration of activity F is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity F is week 2.",
        "Now look at activity C. This activity has to be completed before activities E, H and K begin. From above, we know activity E has to start on week 5, activity H has to start on week 3, and activity K has to start on week 4. That means that C has to finish by week 3. The duration of activity C is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity C is week 1. The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors.",
        "Now look at activity B. This activity has to be completed before activities C and D begin. From above, we know activity C has to start on week 1, and activity D has to start on week 6. That means that B has to finish by week 1. The duration of activity B is 1 week and therefore the latest start on activity B is week 0.  The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors.",
        "Now look at activity A. This activity has to be completed before activities D, E, F and G begin. From above, we know activity D has to start on week 6, activity E has to start on week 5, activity F has to start on week 2 and activity G has to start on week 2. That means that A has to finish by week 2. The duration of activity A is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity A is week 0.  The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors.",
        "The latest start and latest finish times, along with early times for the entire project, are shown in the following figure.",
        "The slack for an activity is the difference between its latest finish time and its earliest finish time.In symbols,Slack = LF – EF (Since LF – EF = LS – ES, either difference can actually be used to calculate slack.)",
        "Each activity with zero slack is on a critical path through the project network, to the extent that any delay along this path will delay project completion. Critical path is the sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to be able to meet the scheduled completion. Any delay in any of these activities will extend the project completion time.",
        "The figure below shows the activities having zero slack. This project has multiple critical paths. They are identified in the list of paths following the diagram.",
