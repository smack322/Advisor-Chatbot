        "To draw a causal loop diagram, you should begin by drawing behavior over time (BOT) graphs. Here’s how to create BOTs:",
        "Building a Causal Loop Diagram",
        "“A short-term symptomatic “solution” is used to correct a problem, with seemingly positive immediate results. As this correction is used more and more, more fundamental long-term corrective measures are used less and less. Over time, the capabilities for the fundamental solution may atrophy or become disabled, leading to even greater reliance on the symptomatic solution.” [Senge]",
        "Figure 6.3 shows an example of Shifting the Burden:",
        "When constructing CLDs we don’t really care what about the nature of the variable – how or if it can be measured, what units it might have, the scale of those units, or the concrete relationship between two linked variables (for example, what mechanism connects a players anxiety level regarding their beer deliveries to their ordering strategy?) What we care about is documenting the critical variables and the direction each moves in relation to one another (same or opposite) so that we can determine the type of loop structures created (reinforcing or balancing).",
        "In order to simulate the model, however, we need to define the nature of the variables, their units, scales, and how they affect each other. The first step is to determine which variables are stocks and which are flows.",
        "The easiest way to think of stocks and flows is with a bathtub analogy shown in Figure 7.2. The level of water in the bathtub is the stock and would be measured in liters or gallons, say. The only way the level of water in the bathtub can increase is if the faucet was turned on and water flowed into the tub. That flow would be measured in liters/minute or gallons/minute. Equally, the only way the level of water would decrease is if the plug was removed from the drain and water flowed out of the tub. Again, this flow would be measured in l/min or gpm. Without a flow (the faucet or drain) the stock (the level of water) cannot change.",

        "This lesson introduces the foundational concepts of stock and flow modeling, helping you understand the differences between rates (flows) and levels (stocks). You’ll learn how these elements interact to create the dynamic behavior observed in complex systems.",
        "By completing this module, you’ll be able to distinguish between stocks and flows, develop stock and flow models, and use policy simulators to analyze and guide decisions in complex systems.",
        "SSYEN 507 equips professionals with the critical skills needed to address complex, interconnected challenges in various industries. By mastering concepts like causal loop diagrams, stock and flow models, and system archetypes, students develop the ability to analyze systemic structures and identify leverage points for meaningful change. These skills are in high demand across sectors such as technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and government, where systems thinking is essential for designing efficient, scalable, and sustainable solutions.",
        "Graduates of this course are well-prepared for roles like Systems Engineer, Policy Analyst, Operations Manager, and Strategic Planner. Employers value candidates with the ability to approach problems holistically, model system behavior, and collaborate across disciplines to address “wicked problems.” Adding SYSEN507 to your resume demonstrates a strong foundation in systems thinking and quantitative modeling—key qualifications for advancing in a competitive job market.",
        "A real-world example of a systems thinking challenge can be seen in urban transportation planning. A city faced growing congestion and pollution due to increasing car usage, which impacted air quality, commute times, and overall quality of life. Stakeholders included commuters, public transportation agencies, environmental advocates, businesses, and city planners, each with conflicting priorities. Commuters desired convenience and affordability, while environmental groups pushed for reduced emissions. Meanwhile, local businesses worried about the economic impact of reduced car access to shopping areas. Initial attempts to solve the problem with isolated interventions—such as adding bike lanes or implementing tolls—failed to address the broader systemic issues, leading to unintended consequences like increased traffic in neighboring areas and public backlash.",
        "To address this, systems engineers applied the principles of SYSENG 507 by creating a holistic system dynamics model. Using causal loop diagrams (CLDs), they mapped the relationships between variables like public transit availability, road usage, air pollution, and economic activity. They then transitioned to stock and flow models to simulate the long-term impact of various policy decisions, such as expanding public transit, implementing congestion pricing, and incentivizing electric vehicle usage. Stakeholders were engaged throughout the process to ensure their perspectives were represented in the model.",
        "The resulting policy simulation revealed that a combination of public transit expansion and congestion pricing could reduce traffic while maintaining economic activity. This approach allowed the city to implement targeted policies with broad stakeholder support, ultimately reducing congestion, lowering emissions, and improving the quality of life for residents. This example highlights the critical role of systems thinking and quantitative modeling in addressing complex, interconnected challenges, demonstrating the real-world value of skills learned in SYSENG 507.",
