        "BUSAD 843: People Analytics is a three-credit course provides students with the skills to integrate process modeling, data analytics, and evidence-based decision-making into the management of people within organizations. Designed to bridge traditional human resource (HR) practices with data-driven approaches, the course prepares students to leverage HR information systems and analytical tools to make strategic, measurable decisions.",
        "Through a combination of readings, hands-on activities, and real-world case studies, students will model HR processes, develop data queries, analyze results, and generate actionable reports. Key HR areas such as talent selection, compensation, performance evaluation, productivity management, training and development, and occupational health will be explored. Students will also learn to apply HR metrics to assess diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and evaluate the impact of HR processes on broader business outcomes.",
        "By the end of this course, students will gain a leadership perspective that values evidence-based decision-making. They will enhance their ability to interpret and communicate insights from people data, effectively supporting organizational change efforts and strategic initiatives. Overall, students will leave with the analytical and technical skills needed to drive success in modern HR management.",
        "BUSAD 843 is a World Campus (WC) course offered 100% online to Penn State graduate students, including MBA students and students in other professional master’s programs. This course counts as an elective in the Talent and Diversity Leadership concentration in the OMBA program and in the Analytics for Managers, Leading in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and Human Resource Management graduate certificate programs. The topics, insights, and applications addressed in this course are also relevant to other graduate programs that develop students’ business analytics and decision-making skills.",
        "People analytics is centered at the intersection of an organization’s business and (HR) strategy, statistics, technology systems, and the application of scientific methods. Students in this course will gain hands-on experience by using a mock company database to test their analytic models and their ideas about how to address the questions that business professionals have about people working in organizations. Students will also have the opportunity to model a real-world management challenge and evaluate the analytical techniques and augmented decision-making tools that could be used to reach an outcome or decision.",
        "BUSAD 801 or STAT 500 or instructor/program approval. Students are typically expected to have completed a prior statistics course at the undergraduate or graduate level.",
        "The course will provide you with an in-depth look at how to:",
        "A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment. Grading of class projects and exams involves a scoring rubric and comparison to products/exams of other students in the class. Each student should consider that s/he is starting the course with a mean (average) grade. Student work will either lower or raise this grade. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments. Student work will be graded as:",
        "The grade-point equivalents for +/- marks are A- (3.67), B+ (3.33), B- (2.67), and C+(2.33).",
        "*Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 93-100, A- = 90-92.99, B+ = 87-89.99, B =83 -86.99, B- = 80-82.99, C+ = 77-79.99, C = 70-76.99, D = 60-69.99, and F = Below 60",
        "There are 14 weekly discussion forums in this course. Students will be evaluated based on their timely and meaningful responses to forum questions. At a minimum, each student is expected to post one direct response to the prompt and one response to other students’ postings for each forum question. Quality of interaction is always valued over quantity. In addition, students are highly encouraged to share references to additional and relevant resources with the rest of the class via posting to the appropriate forum. Weekly class discussions will be evaluated using two criteria on a 5-point scale (10 points total). The 12 discussions with the highest grades will be used in the final calculation for class participation.",
        "The goal of the assigned exercises is the understanding, based on hands-on experience, of the translation of managerial questions into research questions answerable through data analysis. Several walk-throughs of the exercises, including sample queries, are provided in the lessons for the class. Each student will prepare a summary report of the exercises they completed; a minimum of two completed exercises is required. If a third exercise is completed, we will count the two highest grades earned for this assignment.",
        "Working in teams of 2-4 students throughout the semester, students will complete online activities designed to reflect and extend the reading assignments and class notes. These team activities and their corresponding team discussions span more than one week/lesson. Hence, team reports may entail more than one part as the team works through an activity. A total of three (3) team reports are assigned.",
        "Working within their team, students will decide on an HRM area of interest and will select a decision that managers typically must make in that area. Students will 1) develop a model for the focal HR process or problem, 2) develop an analytics model that describes at least one of the decision processes, 3) list the data and data characteristics required for a decision, 4) describe the process used to get and organize the data and the analytical techniques and tools that would be used to reach an outcome or decision, and 5) describe the anticipated deployment and life cycle management of the model. Students may use available databases and other resources to demonstrate the feasibility of their approach and anticipated outcomes, but actual data collection, determination of an outcome, and validation is not required. Students will present and discuss their projects in a forum during the last week of class.",
        "At the end of the semester, each student will be asked to rate and comment on the individual contributions of team members, including themselves throughout the course. A form for this evaluation is provided. The individual grade on this assignment will reflect the overall ratings provided by the members of each team as well as the instructor’s evaluation of the quality and completeness of the submitted peer review form.",

        "Let’s look more deeply at the three types of analytics and the pertinent questions that are posed to gather the correct data.",
        "Descriptive Analytics: In the exploration of data analytics, we find the foundational layer of Descriptive Analytics. The quintessential question associated with this layer is: “What happened?” This can be analogized to the story beginning with, “Once upon a time…” Within this framework, descriptive analytics describes and frames what happened in the past by analyzing and visualizing data from an event or phenomena that has already occurred.",
        "Predictive Analytics:  At the core, predictive analytics endeavors to forecast impending events by gauging probabilities and discerning emergent trends.  The question associated with this layer is: “What will happen next?”  This can be analogized to the story beginning with “Changes are….” Such forecasts are predicated upon the relationships discerned within the data and models germinated from our earlier understanding via descriptive analytics, incorporating tools such as regression analysis and machine learning. In essence, predictive analytics embodies the art and science of prognostication, grounded in rigorous statistical evaluation of historical, contemporary, and prospective data trajectories.",
        "Prescriptive Analytics: Prescriptive analytics endeavors to prescribe what should happen, or what is the best course of action given what we know from the data.  Also, what we perceive to be constraints and opportunities, not as widely used as machine learning. The question associated with this layer is “What should I do?” This can be analogized to the story beginning with, “The best thing to do…” It not only informs but also counsels on the optimal path forward, taking into account our amassed data knowledge, and the constraints and opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "Several articles are included as course resources to describe the legal and ethical issues and guidelines re: privacy laws, risk management, and people data protection.",
        "Calculating Employee Lifetime Value involves considering various elements such as the employee’s productivity, contributions to projects, potential for innovation, and their impact on team dynamics. It goes beyond just financial metrics and takes into account the overall value an employee adds to the company culture and success. ELV is valuable for strategic human resources management, helping organizations make informed decisions about talent acquisition, development, and retention. Understanding and maximizing Employee Lifetime Value is crucial for creating a workforce that not only meets current needs but also contributes to the sustained growth and success of the organization over time.  ​",
