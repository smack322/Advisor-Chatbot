        "As your project progresses, you will find it necessary to have synchronous virtual meetings. Be sure to record your meeting for later viewing by myself or from members of your group who may have been unable to attend. In the past, some groups have elected to hold conference calls using calling facilities available through one of the group member’s work place. This is acceptable as well, although if you choose this option, please record detailed meeting notes and to post these notes after the call.",
        "All these communication methods allow your instructor to follow your work and offer suggestions, when appropriate. Furthermore, as you see from the grading rubric, your grade is based on a group portion as well as an individual portion. Following your discussions and chats allows your instructor to more accurately assess your individual contributions.",
        "It may be helpful for your group to have a Project Manager. You should be familiar with the role of the project manager. The project manager would be expected to play a smaller technical role and take on the major responsibility of planning, organization, and implementation of the system engineering functions of your project. The project manager would also be the point of contact for the customer, i.e. the instructor!",
        "As added incentive for assuming the role of project manager you’ll see in the grading section below, that a portion of your overall grade is based on your individual contribution to the project. Doing a good job as project manager is one way to maximize this portion of your grade.",
