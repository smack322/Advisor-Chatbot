        "SYSEN 536: Unlock your potential to make better, more informed decisions with our innovative course. Many people struggle with decision-making, often waiting until the last minute and hoping their challenges will resolve themselves. When the pressure is on, they rush through choices, convincing themselves they could have done better with more time. The reality is, most of us have never been formally taught how to make effective decisions—we rely solely on past experiences or external advice. Yet, the toughest decisions often arise in unfamiliar territory, leaving us to navigate without a roadmap.",
        "In this course, you’ll discover proven methodologies to enhance your decision-making process. Rather than telling you what to decide, we focus on teaching you how to decide. Whether you’re facing personal or professional choices, you’ll gain the skills needed to approach new situations with confidence, clarity, and a structured mindset.",
        "This course is designed to provide students with the insights into the decision making process, capabilities to examine and analyze decisions under uncertainties within the context of engineering and technology. It focuses on understanding and improving the decision-making process and developing capabilities of individuals and groups in technical organizations. Emphasis is placed on evaluation methods; identification, modeling, and problem resolution; consequences/outcomes of the action taken; risk analysis and quantification.",
        "Even though there are no official prerequisites in the catalog, all students are expected to have taken an elementary course (or have some knowledge) in probability theory and statistics. The elements of probability theory necessary for the course will be quite basic and will be reviewed as needed. You will also be expected to use our online discussion forums, chat rooms, and electronic mail on a regular basis. The most important prerequisite of all, however, is your interest in the course, motivation and commitment to learning.",
        "After completing the course, a student will be able to:",

With purchase of the book, students have complimentary access to the software at www.cengagebrain.com.",
        "Note that the DecisionSuite Tool is not compatible with the Mac machine. You can access the “Handouts” folder to look for the “PSU Great Valley-Virtual Lab” PDF file, from which you can follow the instructions to use the DecisionSuite Tool on the Virtual PC Machine via the PSU network.",
        "The homeworks are individual effort. You can discuss the topic in the weekly discussion forum (five discussion forums available for each homework), but not the exact problem. You need to submit the homework on time to keep up with the course schedule, and do well on the exams.",
        "At the end of week 4 you will be given a midterm exam (individual effort) containing 4 problems that cover the materials from Week 1 to Week 3. It will be available to you on Monday at 7:00 AM and should be completed by midnight on the following Sunday. Midterm exam is worth 30%. The comprehensive final exam (individual effort) contains four problems that cover the materials from Week 1 to Week 6. But the exam will focus more on the materials from Week 4 to Week 6. The exam will be given on Monday of Week 7 and will be due by midnight on the following Sunday as well. Final exam is worth 30%.",
        "A grade is given on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41).",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",

        "There will be discussion forums for students to discuss among themselves different aspects of the course, and I will participate in the discussions when it is appropriate. Use the discussion forums to post your questions and to read the responses from your classmates. Homework and Exams are on an individual basis. Questions on these should be directed to me. I will send additional information if many students are experiencing particular problems.",

We denote decision alternatives as (d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots) and chance events (states of nature) as (s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots). It’s important to note that the decision maker cannot influence the states of nature.

        "This approach is also referred to as MaxMin approach, which takes the maximum of the minimum payoff from each decision alternative.",
        "This is neither optimistic nor conservative, but somewhere in the middle. In this case, we create a regret table, as follows. If the state of nature is s1, the best payoff will be 10 and if the decision was d1, then there is no regret. If the decision is d2, the regret is 2 (10-8), and if the decision is d3, the regret is 4 (10-6). If the state of nature is s2, the best payoff is 18 where the regret is 0, and the regret is 3 and 2 corresponding to d1 and d3, respectively. Thus we create the regret table from the payoff table.",
        "We calculate the maximum regret for each decision alternative and the decision is to minimize the maximum regret. In this case, we choose d3.",
