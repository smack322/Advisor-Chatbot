        "Financial markets are crucial in our economy. Next, you can find a few ways how these financial markets can play a role in our economy.",
        "We will briefly examine each of these markets, key statistics, and how we will examine them throughout this course.",
        "(SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE)",
        "First, we will look at Debt Markets & Interest Rates. Debt markets allow governments, corporations, and individuals to borrow. The borrowers will issue a security, called a bond, offering interest and principal over time. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing. Moreover, many types of market interest rates co-exist such as mortgage rates, car loan rates, credit card rates, etc. The levels of these rates are important. For example, mortgage rates in the early part of 1983 exceeded 13%. Lastly, understanding the history of interest rates is beneficial as it lets you see the fluctuation of these rates over time.",
        "Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED database",
        "In Lesson 2 (chapters 3 through 4), we will examine the characteristics of interest rates before examining its roles in various debt markets in the economy in Lesson 3 (chapters 5, 11 and 12).",
        "The stock market is the market where common stock (or just stock) are traded. Companies initially sell stock (in the primary market) to raise money. After that, the stock is traded in the secondary market among investors. The stock market receives the most attention from the media. As suggested by Figure 1.2, stock prices are extremely volatile.",
        "Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED database",
        "Companies, not just individuals, also watch the market often to seek additional funding via seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). The success of SEOs is dependent on the company’s stock performance. We will examine the role of the stock market in the financial system while we will further look at how stock prices behave to information in the marketplace in Lesson 4 (chapters 6 and 13).",
        "The foreign exchange market is where international currencies trade and exchange rates are set. Although most people know little about this market, as you can see in Figure 1.3, it has a daily volume around $5 trillion!",
        "Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED database",
        "These fluctuations matter not only to corporation, but also consumers! In recent years, consumers have found that vacationing in Europe is expensive, due to a weakening dollar relative to the Euro. When the dollar strengthens, foreign purchase of domestic goods falls.",
        "In Lesson 5 (chapter 15 and its Appendix), we will examine how exchange rates are determined in both the short- and long-run.",
        "In the past years, the economic environment has become more volatile than ever before and an increasingly risky place. For example, interest rates unpredictably fluctuated, stock market experienced crash and bubbles one after another in US and abroad. Foreign exchange market has not been an exception to the speculative crises. Amid financial turmoil, failure of financial institutions is not uncommon, reaching unprecedented level since the Great Depression. To avoid wild swings in profitability (and even possibly failure) resulting from this environment, financial institutions must find ways to cope with increased risks in various financial markets.",
        "Before we look at techniques that these financial institutions use to manage unnecessary risks in Lesson 7 (Chapter 23), we will look at how these financial institutions make use of new financial derivatives, such as financial futures, options and swaps to engage in risk management in Lesson 6 (Chapter 24).",
        "We will look at the basic reasoning behind the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). We also examine empirical evidence examining this idea. Lastly, we will look at what the EMH implies for investors.",
        "(SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Theoretically, the EMH tells us that current prices in a financial market will be set so that the optimal forecast of a security’s return using all available information equals the security’s equilibrium return. To put it differently, financial economists state it more simply: A security’s price fully reflects all available information in an efficient market. How could it be possible? To fully understand why the EMH makes sense, we need to understand how arbitragers can engage in an unexploited profit opportunity where they can earn arbitrage profits. We will discuss how arbitrage profits can be earned in detail later in lesson 5, but for now, let’s define the unexploited profit opportunity.",
        "When an unexploited profit opportunity arises on a security (so-calledbecause, on average, people would be earning more than they should, given the characteristics of that security), investors will rush to buy until the price rises to the point that the returns are normal again.",
        "If financial markets are efficient, then all unexploited profit opportunities will be eliminated instantaneously so that not every investor need be aware of every security and situation to identify whether the current price is in its equilibrium.",
        "If a few (namely arbitragers) keep their eyes open for unexploited profit opportunities, they will eliminate the profit opportunities that appear because in so doing, they make a profit.",
        "Let’s first look at empirical evidence supporting the market efficiency.",
        "(SELECT EACH TAB BELOW)",
        "Theoretically, the weak-form EMH suggests that technical analysis (which focuses on past stock price data, searching for patterns such as trends and regular cycles, suggesting rules for when to buy and sell stocks) is a waste of time because all information on past stock price data is already reflected into the current stock price.",
        "The simplest way to understand why is to use the random-walk result that holds that past stock price data cannot help predicting changes. Therefore, technical analysis, which relies on such data to produce its forecasts, cannot successfully predict changes in stock prices because the weak-form EMH assumes that stock price will move randomly in the future. Foreign exchange (FX) rates are a good example supporting the weak form EMH. Oddly enough, empirical tests show that FX rates exhibit random walk behavior like stocks so that they are not very predictable based on past trends.",
        "Theoretically, the semi-strong form of EMH suggests that not only past stock price data, but also all publicly available information are already reflected into the current stock price so that a positive (negative) announcement about a company will not, on average, raise (lower) the price of its stock because this information is already reflected in the stock price.",
        "Early empirical evidence confirms: any expected favorable earnings announcements or announcements of stock splits (a division of a share of stock into multiple shares, which is usually followed by higher earnings) do not, on average, cause stock prices to rise.",
        "Therefore, investment strategies using inside information is the only “proven method” to beat the market under the semi-strong EMH. In the U.S., it is illegal to trade on such information, but that is not true in all countries.",
        "The strong form EMH argues that not only past stock price data and public information, but also inside information are already reflected into the current stock price so that stock price movement cannot be predicted and follows random walk behavior.",
        "Empirical evidence supporting the strong-form EMH includes: The “Investment Dartboard” often beats investment managers; Mutual funds not only do not outperform the market on average, but when they are separated into groups according to whether they had the highest or lowest profits in a chosen period, the mutual funds that did well in the first period do not beat the market in the second period.",
        "We will now examine some of the more recent evidence that casts some doubt on Market Efficiency. Early empirical studies are generally supporting the efficient market hypothesis, but recent studies have begun to show market anomalies which indicate the efficient market hypothesis may not always be generally applicable. Market anomalies are great challenges to the theory of efficient markets so that investors might be able to earn abnormal returns by exploiting market anomalies listed below.",
        "Now let’s look at what implications the EMH provides to investors by considering the following questions.",
        "(Scroll through each slide to learn more)",
        "According to the semi-strong EMH, information in the published reports by sell-side analysts is readily available to many market players and is already reflected in the market price. Therefore, acting on this information will not allow investors to earn abnormal returns.",
        "One question arises from this argument. If this is true, then we should not observe sell-side analysts to issue their research reports any longer. But, we have more than 3,000 sell-side analysts working in the US stock markets.",
        "A large literature in finance and accounting documents that sell-side analysts provide value to investors through their research reports. Specifically, analyst upgrades (to earnings, price targets, recommendations) result in positive abnormal returns while downgrades result in negative abnormal returns. The literature identifies two main ways in which analysts provide value. First, analysts engage in information discovery, where they generate new signals regarding firm fundamentals by talking to the management of the firm, its competitors, suppliers etc. Second, analysts engage in information interpretation, where they quantify the value implication of information events that affect the firm, such as earnings releases or other industry or macro news. In information discovery, the analyst generates private or proprietary information, while in information interpretation, the analyst reacts to public information. (please see Daniel, Lee, and Naveen, 2019 for more information on the role of sell-side analysts)",
        "YES. The EMH indicates that you should be skeptical of hot tips since, if the stock market is efficient, it has already priced the hot tip stock so that its expected return will equal the equilibrium return. Thus, the hot tip is not particularly valuable and will not enable you to earn an abnormally high return.",
        "As soon as the information hits the street, the unexploited profit opportunity it creates will be quickly eliminated. The stock’s price will already reflect the information, and you should expect to realize only the equilibrium return.",
        "NO. In an efficient market, stock prices will respond to announcements only when the information being announced is new and unexpected. So, if good news was expected (or as good as expected), there will be no stock price response. And, if good news was unexpected (or not as good as expected), there will be a stock price response.",
        "Investors should not try to outguess the market by constantly buying and selling securities. This process does nothing but incur commissions costs on each trade.",
        "Instead, the investor should pursue a “buy and hold” strategy—purchase stocks and hold them for long periods of time. This will lead to the same returns, on average, but the investor’s net profits will be higher because fewer brokerage commissions will have to be paid.",
        "It is frequently a sensible strategy for a small investor, whose costs of managing a portfolio may be high relative to its size, to buy into a mutual fund rather than individual stocks. Because the EMH indicates that no mutual fund can consistently outperform the market, an investor should not buy into one that has high management fees or that pays sales commissions to brokers but rather should purchase a no-load (commission-free) mutual fund that has low management fees.",
        "As we practiced, the change in interest rate will affect both NIM and Net worth of the First National Bank as summarized below.",
        "What can the bank manager do to manage interest-rate risk once the manager has done the income gap analysis and duration gap analysis?",
        "Deciding which strategy to choose to manage interest rate risk will depend on the manager’s expectation/belief about how interest rate will move in the future.",
        "The manager may have two strategies available to choose from to hedge against possible interest rate hike in the future depending on which gap analysis the manager prefers to use.",
        "One problem with eliminating the interest rate risk for the bank by altering the balance sheet (i.e, selling long-term assets to buy short-term assets to decrease DURASSETS) is that doing so might be very costly in the short run because the bank may be locked into assets and liabilities of particular durations because of its field of expertise.",
        "Fortunately, recently developed financial derivatives, such as interest-rate futures/forward and interest-rate options can help the manager mitigate potential interest rate risk without rearranging its balance sheets. Next, we will discuss how an interest-rate swap can help the manager manage the interest rate risk.",
        "Let’s first understand key attributes of a typical plain vanilla [6] interest rate swap before discussing how to use it for hedging purpose.",
        "Suppose there are two financial institutions: Midwest Savings Bank (MSB) and Friendly Finance Company (FFC).",
        "Midwest Savings Bank (MSB) which borrows short-term mostly from depositors in a form of deposits and lends long-term in the mortgage market has $1 million less of rate-sensitive assets (RSAs) than it has of rate-sensitive liabilities (RSLs).",
        "As we discussed, MSB currently has negative income gap (RSAs<RSLs) by $1 million. The negative income gap suggests that if interest rate rise in the future, the rise in the cost of funds (liabilities) is greater than the rise in interest incomes it can earn on assets, more of which are fixed-rate mortgage, leading to a shrinking of MSB’s NIM (net interest margin) and a decline in its profitability.",
        "In the meanwhile, the manager of the Friendly Finance Company (FFC) which issues long-term bonds to raise funds and uses them to make short-term loan finds that FFC is in exactly the opposite position to MSB: FFC has $1 million more of RSAs than of RSLs so that FFC has positive income gap (RSAs>RSLs) by $1 million.",
        "The positive income gap suggests that if interest rate falls in the future, the decline in interest incomes it can earn on assets is greater than the decrease in the cost of funds (liabilities), leading to a shrinking of its NIM (net interest margin) and a decline in its profitability.",
        "Let’s summarize interest rate risk that each financial institution currently has.",
        "To mitigate this interest rate risk, the manager of MSB would have an incentive to convert $1 million of its fixed-rate mortgages to RSAs, thereby eliminating the income gap while the manager of FFC would have an incentive to convert $1 million of its RSAs to fixed-rate assets, thereby eliminating the income gap.",
        "Let’s see how the plain vanilla interest swap can help both managers satisfy their hedging needs.",
        "Suppose there is a plain vanilla interest rate swap whose NP is $1million, matures in 10 years with floating rate [7] of T-bill rate plus 1% and fixed rate of 7% available for both MSB and FFC.",
        "Both agree to enter into the swap contract where MSB (fixed-rate payer) agrees to pay FFC a fixed rate of 5% on NP of $1 million for the next 10 years, and FFC (floating-rate payer) agrees to pay MSB the one-year T-bill rate [8] + 1% on the same NP for the next 10 years.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 7.1 below, under the swap contract, every year MSB is obligated to pay the fixed interest payment of $50,000 (=fixed rate of 5% times $1 million) to FFC and receive variable interest payments (to be determined at (T-bill rate +1%) times $1 million) from FFC.",
        "Therefore, as market interest rate rises in the future, the variable interest payments that MSB will receive from FFC will rise while the fixed interest payments that MSB needs to pay to FFC is fixed at $50,000, leading to higher NIM and profitability. In other words, now thanks to the interest-rate swap, MSB is now protected from interest rate risk (i.e., rate-hike) in the future.",
        "To the contrary, under the swap contract, every year FFC is obligated to pay variable interest payments (to be determined at (T-bill rate +1%) times $1 million) to MSB and receive the fixed interest payment of $50,000 (=fixed rate of 5% times $1 million) from MSB.",
        "Therefore, as market interest rate drops in the future, the interest payments that FFC will receive from MSB will be fixed at $50,000 while the interest payments that FFC needs to pay to MSB will decline, leading to higher NIM and profitability. In other words, now thanks to the interest-rate swap, FFC is also now protected from interest rate risk (i.e., interest rate drop) in the future.",

        "A real-world example of the application of concepts learned in Analysis of Financial Markets can be seen in how investment firms use market analysis to make decisions about stock or bond investments. For instance, when analyzing the bond market, students can apply concepts such as interest rate risk and credit risk to assess bond prices and yield curves. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, investment firms closely monitored central bank policies, interest rates, and government stimulus measures to navigate market volatility. By using tools like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or risk management strategies, students will gain the knowledge to predict market movements, manage risks, and make data-driven decisions in real-world financial markets.",

However, given that NP is not exchanged under the swap contract, the default risk is limited to periodic interest rate payments to be made by each party under the swap contract.Just like forward contract, financial intermediaries such as IBs help reduce disadvantages associated with swap contract, but at a cost!."
