        "DAAN 822: This course is valued at 3 credits, and students will learn key tools and techniques for collecting, preparing, and cleaning data for analysis. Inaccurate or inconsistent data can skew results, so the course focuses on methods for identifying and correcting errors in large datasets. Topics include automated data collection, retrieving data from existing databases, and applying error detection and cleansing techniques to ensure data quality and reliability.",
        "Over the next weeks in the Data Collection and Cleaning course, we will explore the tools and techniques required for data collection and computational procedures to automatically or semi-automatically identify and eliminate errors in large datasets. The presence of incorrect and inconsistent data can significantly distort the results of the data analysis often negating the potential benefits of information-driven approaches. As a result, a variety of research over the last decades has focused on data cleansing: computational procedures to automatically or semi-automatically identify – and, when possible, correct – errors in large data sets. The goal of this course is to explore and discuss different data collection tools and techniques in addition to learning skills for retrieving data from existing databases. To further enforce data quality and reliability this course will introduce techniques for error detection and data cleaning on large databases. Please take a moment to review the course syllabus by clicking on the Syllabus tab in the left-hand menu. Here you will find out about the topics we will be covering, the assignments and grading scheme, and the University’s policy on academic integrity and how it impacts this course.",
        "Before we move on to the details, however, I would like you to familiarize yourselves with Canvas and the structure I will be using throughout this course. Under Modules, you will find a page that links you to the beginning of each weekly lesson. Within each set of weekly lessons, pages will be the links to the course’s discussion forums, assignments, readings, etc. Over the coming weeks, each week’s learning materials will appear in step with our progress though the materials. You can expect to see new modules and their assignments appearing each Monday, but you should be checking in every day so you can track and contribute to the discussion forums that are ongoing.",
        "For some topics we will have a discussion forum that will serve as our medium to interact collectively. I will pose questions to feed the discussion, but you should all feel free to pose additional questions related to that board’s topic. I plan to be online at least once every day including weekends to respond to questions and any other issues that may arise. Of course, you can still email me personally on any issue or topic and I will usually respond within 24 hours. On this note, please ensure that you email me from within Canvas so that all course communications are kept secure.",
        "If you are taking an online course for the first time, please be aware that learning online will be somewhat different from learning in the traditional classroom. On one hand, online classes give you a bit more flexibility by not requiring you to be in class at a specified time or being asked an impromptu question by the professor. On the other hand, you cannot raise your hand to ask a clarification question, nor can you stop by the professor’s office for help with a difficult assignment. Under Modules, click the Course Introduction Forum and take a moment to tell the class something about yourself and your background.",

        "In all qualitative enquiries observation is a fundamental and highly important method. The process of observation entitles to the systematic noting and recording of events, behaviors, and artifacts in the social setting chosen for study. The recordings of events are often referred to as field notes. A qualitative researcher when performing an observation records frequently a detailed, nonjudgmental and concrete description of what was observed. The collection of data through observation can range from a highly structured, detailed notation of behavior structured by checklists to a more holistic description of the events and behavior. Generally a researcher enters the setting with broad areas of interest but without a predetermined categories or strict observational checklists. This way the researcher is able to make a note of all the recurring patterns of behavior and relationships. A complete analysis of the field notes is performed in order to identify and describe the patterns thus making the checklists more appropriate and context-sensitive. Performing classroom studies is a good example of observation in an educational setting. The figure 2.1 below shows a sample edited and cleaned-up field notes for a study of the Kindergarten teachers. The researcher has formatted the field note with descriptive notes in the column on the left while reserving the right side column for comments. Note that in the top the researcher has recorded the date and time of the observed event. In addition to that at times the researcher records the location of the observation. In this field note the researcher has recorded his observation about the room which is in the basement of the school. Pay a close attention to the details recorded in the field notes especially the number of people in the room, the age of the bricks that are part of the building, the dimension of the room, the location of the objects (furniture, racks books, toys etc.) in the room, pictures in the wall, the lighting conditions in the room etc. On the right hand side you can see the comments made by the researcher [1].",
        "As indicated before, observation is a core part of the qualitative research studies. In every other qualitative study techniques observations play an important role. For example in in-depth interviews observations play a key role. When performing an in-depth interview the researcher makes a record of the participant’s behavior, body language and other associated information in his field notes. In short, observation is an integral part of qualitative research study [1].",
        "A type of observation developed primarily from cultural anthropology and qualitative sociology perspective is the method often referred to as participant observation. As the name suggest it requires the researcher to be an active participant and demands for the involvement of the researcher in the social setting. The immersion of researchers in the settings permits them to see, hear, and begin to experience reality as the participants do. This immersion offers the researcher the opportunity to learn directly from their own experience. Street ethnography is an example of participant observation where the researcher is immersed in a research setting that is usually associated with a dangerous environment. For example the researcher is working with the police, drug users, cults, and situations in which political or social tensions may erupt into violence [1].",
        "Qualitative in-depth interviews (interviews) are typically conversations than formal events with predetermined response categories. It is often defined as a conversation with a purpose. Before researchers (interviewer) interviews the participants they explores few general topics to help uncover the participant’s views but otherwise they respect participants frame and structure of responses. The objective of the researcher is to understand the participant’s perspective on the phenomenon of interest which should unfold as the participant views it and not as the researcher views it. For a successful interview to be conducted, researcher should have some degree of systematization and structured questioning.  Secondly, the researcher’s attitude should be conveying the attitude that the participant’s views are valuable and useful. Similar to observations even in interviews the researchers maintains a field note. The figure 2.2 below provides an elaborated sample field notes from an interview conducted for a study of students of color in a community college. The researcher objective was to understand how students identified and defined effective teachers. The field note records details about when and what time the interview was conducted and who was the participant, what role the participant plays (advisor with an academic department), interview location (setting), description of the participant and a detailed record of the conversation transcripts. The conversation transcripts, settings and description about the participants are recorded on the left hand column and the interviewer’s notes are recorded in the right hand column. The researcher also makes sure that ethical issues have been taken in to consideration while questioning the participant. The strength of conducting interviews is that it can yield data in quantity quickly. However, it has several limitations. For a successful interview cooperation of the participant is essential. At times the participant will be unwilling, uncomfortable or may be unaware of the recurring patterns in their lives [1].",
        "There are several more specialized forms of interviewing including ethnographic interviewing, phenomenological interviewing, elite interviewing, focus-group interviewing and interviewing children. The ethnographic questions are used by the researcher to gather cultural data of the participant. The value of the ethnographic interview lies in its focus on culture through the perspective of the participants. Using this approach a researcher can elicit from participants about the meaning for events and behaviors and for generating a typology of cultural classification schemes. Ethnographic interview generally focuses on eliciting knowledge about cultures from the perspective of the participants. The phenomenological interviews are specific type of interviews conducted to determine the meaning of a concept or a phenomenon that is shared by several individuals. An interview with an elite person is a specialized case of interviewing that focuses on a particular type of interviewee. They are generally considered to be the most influential person in the organization or community and are selected on the basis of their expertise in areas relevant to the research [1].",
        "The method of interviewing participants in focus groups comes largely from marketing research widely adapted to social sciences and applied research. Small groups consisting of 4 to 12 participants who are unfamiliar with one another are selected to be interviewed because they all share certain characteristics relevant to the study’s question. The focus group interviewing method assumes that an individual’s attitude and beliefs do not form in a vacuum: people often listen to other’s opinions and understandings to form their own. The questions framed by a researcher in a focus-group setting are deceptively simple so as to trick the participants in to expressing their views through the creation of a supportive environment. The advantage of focus group method is that it is socially oriented, studying participants in an atmosphere more natural than artificial experimental circumstances and more relaxed than a one-to-one interview. Disadvantages include issues related to power dynamics, researcher usually has less control over a group interview than on individuals, and there can be a considerable loss of time while dead-end or irrelevant issues are discussed. In some studies researchers consider interviewing children to learn more about the aspects of their world and how they perceive them. The major challenges for researchers in such interviewing process are selecting candidate based on age and role. Choosing between interviewing preschoolers and early adolescents can be quite challenging as preschoolers are active, and cannot be expected to sit still for long hours and can drive one to distraction with their incessant questions as they are in the verge of exploring their emerging language skills. On the other hand early adolescents can be taciturn and can fit well in to focus-group interviews with their peers or in to one-to-one type interviews. The researcher looks along two dimensions of roles when interviewing children namely the extent of positive contact between the adult and child and the extent to which the adult has direct authority over the child [1].",
        "Survey is the most preferred way for the researchers to obtain a small amount of information from a large group of subjects (people).  In survey based research questioners are generally used as tools or instruments. When researchers conduct a survey they generally administer questioners to a set of randomly chosen sample of participants to learn more about the distribution of characteristics, attitudes, or beliefs. The groups of people chosen by researcher are based on the assumption that a characteristic or belief of the group can be described or measured accurately through self-reporting. Researchers also rely on the fact that the participants address to the questioners accurately and honestly. A questioner typically entails several questions that have structured response categories and some open-ended questions. Questions in the questioner are examined (sometimes quite vigorously) for bias, sequence, clarity and face-validity. They are usually tested on a small group to determine their usefulness and, perhaps, reliability.  Surveys are conducted in three ways: by email, telephone and personal interview. Surveys can be either conducted at any single point of time or taken at several different times. Once a survey is completed analysis of the survey data takes the form of descriptive or inferential statistics. Strength of surveys includes accuracy, generalizability, and convenience. Accuracy can however be enhanced by quantification, replicability and control over observer effects. Results of a survey can be generalized to a larger population within error bounds and they are amenable to rapid statistical analysis and are comparatively easy to administer and manage. However, surveys have several weaknesses. They do not accurately measure the complex social relationships or intricate patterns of interaction. Secondly, a survey cannot assure further evidence that the sample represents a broader universe i.e. results on a sample cannot be generalized over a population with 100% confidence [1].",
        "Cyr and Bonanni in [2] have looked in to the difference in gender (male and female) perceptions in regard to their experience in online shopping.  Their investigation was focused on examining how perceptions between the genders differ concerning transaction security, website design elements (InfoDesign- Information design, NavigDesign – Navigational design, VisDesign- Visual design), website trust, website satisfaction, and e-loyalty, when shopping online. In the Appendix survey of [2] they have provided a questioner that was used for this survey research. Their questioner included 23 questions classified under 7 different categories. For their questioner researchers used a 5-point Likert scale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) to capture the responses of the participants. The 5-point Likert scale allowed the participants to agree-disagree against each question with 1 representing “disagree” and 5 representing “agree”. In another similar study, Srinivasan et. al. in [3] tried to determine if there was any significant difference among the factors namely the transactional security, information design, navigational design, visual design, web site trust, web site satisfaction, and e-loyalty over the sustainability of on-line banking for different banks in USA and in India. Their questioner (provided below in figure 2.3) also included 23 questions based on the 7 major categories. Here it is important to note that both the questioners are different (questions are different in both the questioner) even though they follow a similar pattern. The respondents were instructed to respond against each question in a 5-point Likert scale with 1 meaning “less likely” to 5 meaning “more likely”. The questioner in figure 2.3 also includes several questions to collect the demographic information of the respondents.",
        "In order to design a questioner for your survey research there are several on-line tools namely Google spreadsheet surveys and survey monkey. These sites allow you to design and distribute electronic surveys to the respondents. A tutorial on how to design and distribute electronic surveys using Google spreadsheet surveys and survey monkey is provided here. This tutorial will help you to gain skills and experience with developing an on-line questioner for survey based research.",
        "In the process of performing a qualitative study, researchers come across scenarios where they have to retrieve background, geographical and historical data for a particular setting. Researchers generally supplement participant observation, interviewing, surveys with gathering and analyzing documents produced in the course of every-day events or constructed specifically for the research that they are currently working. Several documents including the Minutes of the meetings, logs, announcements, formal policy statements, letters etc. can be useful for the researchers in understanding the settings or group being studied. When the research subject is a society, community, or an organization then the archival data play a major role in supplementing other qualitative research methods. The specialized analytic approach of retrieving information from the documents is called content analysis. Content analysis has an advantage of being unobtrusive and nonreactive. Researchers first gather the data and then determine where the emphasis lies [1].",
        "Raw data gathered through conducting interviews and observations (field note) now need to be converted to “processed data” through the process of transcription and translation. Transcription could be a complex process. For instance consider a scenario in which the researcher tape records an interview with a respondent and later transcribes the tape. In this process at critical junctions the researcher has to make a judgment involving placing something as simple as a period or a semicolon which otherwise has a potential to shape the meaning of the written word and, hence, of the interview itself. There are several other issues including judiciously drawing inferences and offering interpretations of linguistic patterns, transcribing sentences that were interrupted, topics left unfinished and in ascertaining the overall clarity of the discussions. Translation (from one language to another) on the other hand is more complex than transcribing because they involve more subtle issues related to connotation and meaning. There are several issues that the researcher has to address in the translation process including being a self-translator or involving a translator as part of the analysis, how to determine if a translation has been performed accurately and the subtle meanings of the original language has been captured, translating words and phrases with the same intensity from original language to the target language etc [1].",
        "Finally, rich sources from which data can be collected include WWW (World Wide Web), databases, films, videos and photography. We will look in to WWW and databases in later lessons. In this section we will discuss about reviewing films, videos and photography.  Anthropology related studies have a long history of retrieving data from films and photography. Films, videos and photography has the unique ability to capture visible phenomenon seemingly objectively-yet always from the perspective of the filmmaker. Films, video’s and photography are especially valuable for discovery and validation. They document nonverbal behaviors and communication such as facial expressions, gestures, and emotions. Other advantages include capturing elements which human eyes fail to capture due to limitations, preservation and help in studying data from nonrecurring, disappearing, or rare events. Do these technologies have any weakness? Yes, there are several fundamental questions yet unanswered – What is the nature of the truth? Do these technologies manipulate reality? [1].",
        "Obtaining data/information from literature, books, video (films) and photographs are beyond the scope of this course. In this course we will concentrate on obtaining information from on-line sources including Internet and on-line databases. In the next lesson we will shed some light on the technologies that can help us in collecting data automatically from the WWW or internet.",
        "Data analysis is performed in order to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data source. This step includes both the manual inspection of the data samples as well as examining the metadata to gain an insight about the data properties and to detect any data quality issues.",
        "Transformation workflow and mapping rules which is performed in order to account for the degree of heterogeneity in the number of different data sources and the dirtiness of the data. In this approach a large number of data transformation and cleaning steps are executed in order to map each source to a common data model for any given data warehouse. The schema-related transformations and cleaning are specified by a declarative query and mapping language as far as possible, to enable automatic generation of the transformation code.",
        "Verification is performed (testing and evaluated) to ensure that the transformation workflow and the definitions are implemented correctly and in an effective manner on a sample or copy of the data source. This step also helps in improving the transformation definitions. Here one should be cautions to implement several iterations of the analysis, design and verification steps since some errors only become apparent after applying the transformations.",
        "Transformation is performed by running the ETL workflow whenever there is a need for loading and refreshing the data warehouse or during answering queries from multiple sources.",
        "Backflow of cleaned data is performed to keep the original sources in order after the errors and dirty data are removed and data is cleaned. This is done to keep the legacy applications improved and to avoid redoing the cleaning work for future data extractions.",
