        "BADM 834 is a three-credit course designed to provide an in-depth exploration of financial and investment analysis. This course offers a comprehensive study of asset valuation tools and portfolio management techniques, preparing students to make strategic investment decisions in a dynamic financial landscape.",
        "Through a combination of targeted readings and practical activities, students will delve into the core concepts of security analysis, including financial statement analysis, quantitative techniques, and economic principles. The course emphasizes portfolio management fundamentals, guiding students through the creation of an investment policy statement, asset allocation strategies, optimal portfolio selection, and the evaluation of equity, debt, and alternative assets.",
        "A unique feature of this course is the opportunity for students to apply these principles to the management of their own virtual $100,000 investment portfolio. This hands-on project enhances practical understanding and provides real-world context to the theoretical foundations.",
        "Upon completing BADM 834, students will possess the knowledge and skills to analyze a wide range of financial assets, develop effective investment strategies, and manage portfolios with confidence in a professional setting. This course is ideal for individuals with a foundational understanding of finance, gained through prior coursework or professional experience, looking to elevate their expertise in the field.",
        "This is an advanced finance course that covers topics in investment/portfolio management. The primary focus is on the design of stock portfolios, rather than the details of the pricing of financial instruments or the identification of arbitrage opportunities. That is, this is not a course about stock picking (stock valuation and selection). Only limited time will be devoted to such issues. The course is applied in the sense that various ideas and approaches are subjected to real-world financial data. Instead of describing the institutional details of current investment practice, the course strives to provide a framework that enables students to view investment management in a changing investment environment.",
        "By the end of the course, students will be able to:",
        "The following textbooks are required and may be purchased from MBS Direct:",
        "For pricing and ordering information, please see the Barnes & Noble College website.",

        "*Note: You can access these articles by going to the University Libraries website, clicking on the Course Reserves tab at the top, and searching for “BADM 834”.",
        "A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment. Students are encouraged to seek the instructor’s input during the process of completing each course requirement. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments.",
        "*Student work will be graded according to the following grading scheme:",
        "A = 95-100, A- = 90-94, B+ = 87-89, B = 84-86, B- = 80-83, C+ = 77-79, C = 70-76, D = 65-69, F = Below 65",

        "One of the most important factors in investment analysis is the level of interest rates.  Although difficult to predict, there are three basic determinants of interest rates.",
        "The three basic determinants of interest rates are:",
        "The supply of funds, is determined primarily by the total households’ savings.",
        "Demand for funds, comes from businesses who need funds to invest in plant, equipment, and inventories.",
        "The actions of the government and the Federal Reserve Bank also have an impact on interest rates.",
        "Although the vast majority of investors can be assumed to be risk-averse, it is possible for some investors to be risk-neutral.",
        "Risk neutrality implies that the investor does not take into account the level of risk. In other words, the coefficient of risk aversion, A, for a risk-neutral investor is zero. Risk-neutral investors make decisions solely based on the expected return.",
        "There are also risk-lovers who derive more utility from taking additional risk. A risk lover adjusts the expected return upward when confronting more risk. In other words, these risk lovers enjoy taking risk. Not only do they not penalize the expected return for the risk they take, they even obtain satisfaction from more risk. For these risk lovers, the coefficient of risk aversion is less than zero.",
        "Video: Trade-Off Between Risk and Return",
        "Before investing in mutual funds, investors should be aware of their management fees and other expenses.",
        "Operating expenses: Operating expenses are incurred by the mutual fund through its normal operations and include administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the investment manager. Operating expenses are typically expressed as a percentage of total assets and may range from 0.2% to 2%. These expenses are deducted from the assets of the fund.",
        "Front-end load: A front-end load is assessed when you purchase the shares, usually to pay the brokers who sell the funds. Loads reduce the money invested. For instance, when an investor invests $1,000 in a fund with a front-end load fee of 6%, $60 is taken out as the sales charge and only $940 is invested.",
        "Back-end load: A back-end load is a redemption fee assessed when investors sell the shares. Usually, back-end loads start at 5%–6% and decline by 1% for each year the funds are left invested. These fees are also referred to as “contingent deferred sales charges.”",
        "12b-1 charges: The 12b-1 charges cover the fund distribution costs such as advertising, promotional literature, including annual reports and prospectuses, and commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors. The 12b-1 fees are added to operating expenses to obtain the true annual expense ratio of the fund. The 12b-1 fees cannot be more than 1% of a fund’s average net assets per year. The name “12b-1” is derived from the SEC rule that allows the fund to charge these fees.",

        "During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.",
        "This lesson introduces the foundational concepts of risk and return, critical to effective portfolio design and investment analysis. By exploring how risk and return are measured, students will learn to evaluate potential investments and analyze historical data for informed decision-making.",
        "By completing this lesson, you will have a strong grasp of risk and return fundamentals, setting the stage for advanced portfolio management concepts in subsequent lessons.",
        "This lesson delves into the critical concepts of risk aversion, utility, and the allocation of assets across risky and risk-free investments. Students will learn to assess risk tolerance and make informed decisions about portfolio construction based on their unique risk preferences.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a firm grasp of how to assess risk tolerance and allocate assets effectively, laying the groundwork for advanced portfolio management strategies.",
        "This lesson explores the principles of diversification and its role in reducing portfolio risk.

        "By completing this lesson, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to analyze and optimize portfolio risk through diversification, paving the way for advanced investment strategies.",
        "This lesson focuses on the process of identifying and constructing the optimal risky portfolio (ORP), the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. Students will explore advanced topics such as the Markowitz Portfolio Selection Model, the Separation Theory of Portfolio Construction, and the use of bordered covariance matrices. The lesson also demonstrates how to link the ORP with the risk-free rate to create the capital allocation line (CAL) and utilize Portfolio Visualizer for portfolio analysis.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you’ll have the skills and tools to construct optimal risky portfolios, analyze their performance, and integrate them with risk-free assets to achieve desired investment outcomes.",
        "This lesson focuses on the structure and functionality of investment companies, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Students will gain a detailed understanding of the costs, returns, and performance metrics associated with these investment vehicles and explore how fees can impact overall returns.",
        "By completing this lesson, you will gain the knowledge and analytical skills needed to evaluate mutual funds and ETFs effectively, empowering you to make informed investment decisions and optimize portfolio performance.",
        "This lesson introduces the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and other prominent asset pricing models, alongside an exploration of market efficiency and behavioral finance. Students will learn about the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) in its various forms, the computation of portfolio beta, and the implications of behavioral finance for portfolio management.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a deep understanding of asset pricing models, the concept of market efficiency, and the role of behavioral finance, equipping you to apply these insights to advanced portfolio management strategies.",
        "This lesson focuses on evaluating portfolio performance using various return measures and risk-adjusted metrics. Students will learn to calculate these measures, understand the M2 measure, and explore the concept of style analysis. Contemporary and emerging issues in portfolio management are also discussed, providing insights into modern challenges and practices in the field.",
        "By completing this lesson, you’ll be equipped to evaluate portfolio performance effectively, apply advanced metrics, and navigate emerging issues in portfolio management, preparing you for success in investment analysis and financial decision-making.",
        "BADM 834: Portfolio Management provides students with a comprehensive understanding of investment strategies, asset allocation, and risk management techniques. This course is designed to prepare students for careers in investment management, financial analysis, and wealth advisory services. By mastering the principles of portfolio construction, optimization, and performance evaluation, graduates are equipped to design investment strategies that align with client goals, market conditions, and regulatory requirements.",
        "Professionals with expertise in portfolio management are in high demand across industries such as asset management, private banking, and financial consulting. BADM 834 serves as a foundation for roles such as Portfolio Manager, Investment Analyst, Financial Planner, and Risk Analyst. The hands-on experience gained through virtual portfolio projects and real-world case studies ensures students are prepared to excel in competitive and dynamic financial environments.",
        "A real-world example of portfolio management challenges can be seen in the financial advisory industry. A mid-sized investment firm was managing a high-net-worth client’s portfolio with a goal of achieving steady growth while minimizing risk. However, the portfolio was poorly diversified, with an over-concentration in technology stocks that had performed well in recent years. When market conditions shifted, the portfolio experienced significant volatility, and the client’s returns suffered during a tech sector downturn.",
        "To address this, a portfolio manager was brought in to reassess the investment strategy using principles learned in BADM 834. The manager conducted a thorough analysis of the portfolio’s risk-return profile, rebalancing it to include a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative assets. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and other risk-adjusted measures, the manager identified assets with favorable risk-return characteristics. Additionally, they created a capital allocation line (CAL) to help the client visualize the impact of adding risk-free assets to the portfolio.",
        "The revised portfolio was better aligned with the client’s risk tolerance and investment objectives, resulting in reduced volatility and improved long-term performance. This example highlights the critical role of portfolio management techniques, such as diversification, risk assessment, and optimization, in achieving sustainable investment success and client satisfaction.",
