        "BA 810: Supply Chain Operations Management is a dynamic three-credit course designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of operations management principles across industries. While rooted in manufacturing, the course extends its focus to service sectors such as healthcare, banking, and hospitality, offering students a versatile skill set to excel in diverse business environments. Through a combination of theoretical frameworks and practical applications, students will explore how to efficiently transform resources into goods or services, optimizing processes to minimize costs while maximizing customer satisfaction.",
        "Key topics include process design, supply chain management, quality control, and sustainability, with an emphasis on solving real-world challenges through case studies and interactive projects. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to strategically influence business decisions, drive operational improvements, and understand the interplay between operations and other business functions like marketing and finance. This course is ideal for aspiring consultants, entrepreneurs, and business leaders looking to enhance organizational performance and achieve a competitive edge.",
        "This course focuses on the design, management and improvement of a firm’s business processes.Operations Management is concerned with the transformation of inputs into outputs, in a mannerthat is both efficient and effective, that is, at minimum cost while achieving high customersatisfaction. Examples of inputs are material, equipment, labor, and knowledge. Outputs are goods and/or services. The field of operations management was originally concerned withmanufacturing systems. However, many of the same ideas apply, and many of the same trade-offsare present, in service operations like health care, insurance, hotel management, banking, airlines,and various government operations. As recent experience has shown in global markets, significantcompetitive advantages accrue to those firms most capable of producing quality goods and services efficiently. For this reason the careful design and strategic management of the production process is of fundamental importance for the long-term success/survival of a corporation. We will explore not only the processes within firms, but also between firms (supply chain management).This course is important for you for a number of reasons. You will learn the basics of how tomanage the operations of a firm, and how operational issues affect and are affected by the manybusiness decisions you will be called upon to make or recommend in their careers. As such, thiscourse is essential to students aspiring to become consultants, entrepreneurs, or general managers. A working knowledge of operations is also indispensable to those interested in marketing, finance and accounting, which have a critical interface with operations. An understanding of how firms become market leaders through operations is also important in investment careers. Finally, the systematic analysis of operations will further develop your ability to use analytical approaches to understand and handle various managerial situations.",
