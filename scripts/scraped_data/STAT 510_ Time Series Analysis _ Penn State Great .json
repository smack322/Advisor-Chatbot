        "STAT 510 offers an engaging and practical approach to time series analysis, equipping students with the skills to analyze and interpret patterns in complex, noisy datasets. Designed for those looking to deepen their understanding of statistical forecasting, the course builds progressively, ensuring a solid foundation as you explore advanced topics.",
        "Over the first four weeks, you’ll focus on constructing ARIMA models, both with and without seasonality, mastering this cornerstone method through a step-by-step approach. Beyond ARIMA, the course dives into forecasting techniques, smoothing methods, and analyzing relationships between multiple time series. Additional topics include modeling variation, repeated measures models, and an introduction to periodic series, giving you a comprehensive toolkit for real-world data challenges.",
        "By the end of STAT 510, you’ll view noisy data through a sharper lens, uncovering meaningful patterns and insights that drive better decision-making. Whether you’re forecasting trends, modeling system behavior, or analyzing repeated measurements, this course prepares you to tackle the complexities of time series data with confidence.",
        "This course covers statistical methods for the analysis of data that have been observed over time.  Measurements that are close in time often exhibit high correlation.",

        "The following plot is a time series plot of the annual number of earthquakes in the world with seismic magnitude over 7.0, for 99 consecutive years. By a time series plot, we simply mean that the variable is plotted against time.",
        "Some features of the plot:",
        "Any time series can be expressed as a combination of cosine and sine waves with differing periods (how long it takes to complete a full cycle) and amplitudes (maximum/minimum value during the cycle). This fact can be utilized to examine the periodic (cyclical) behavior in a time series.",
        "A periodogram is used to identify the dominant periods (or frequencies) of a time series. This can be a helpful tool for identifying the dominant cyclical behavior in a series, particularly when the cycles are not related to the commonly encountered monthly or quarterly seasonality",
        "A time series plot follows. We see a regularly repeating pattern that seems to repeat about every 30 or so time periods. This may not be surprising. The stimulus was applied for 16 time periods (of 2 seconds) and not applied for another 16 time periods (of 2 seconds). So, we might expect a repeating pattern every 16+16 = 32 time periods.",
        "The series is n = 128 values of brain cortex activity, measured every 2 seconds for 256 seconds. A stimulus, brushing of the back of the hand, was applied for 32 seconds and then was stopped for 32 seconds. This pattern was repeated for a total of 256 seconds. The series is actually the average of this process for five different subjects.",
        "The periodogram shows a dominant spike at a low frequency –",
        "It’s hard to judge the exact location of the peak. It would help to print out the first few values of the periodogram and the frequencies. The first 16 scaled periodogram values and frequencies follow. The peak value of periodogram is the fifth value, and that corresponds to a frequency of 0.0312500. The period for this value = 1/0.0312500 = 32. That is, it takes 32 time periods for a complete cycle. This is what we expected!",
        "Threshold models are used in several different areas of statistics, not just time series. The general idea is that a process may behave differently when the values of a variable exceed a certain threshold. That is, a different model may apply when values are greater than a threshold than when they are below the threshold. In drug toxicology applications, for example, it may be that all doses below a threshold amount are safe whereas there is increasing toxicity as the dose is increased above the threshold amount. Or, in an animal population abundance study, the population may slowly increase up to a threshold size but then may rapidly decrease (due to limited food) once the population exceeds a certain size.",
        "Section 5.4 of the text covers threshold models and includes a nice example. In this lesson, we’ll discuss the example and provide the R code. The series for the example is monthly rates of deaths due to flu in the United States for 11 years (n = 132). Due to the epidemic nature of the flu, the behavior of the series is quite different when the rates go above some threshold value than when it’s below the value.",
        "The first step (always) is to plot the data. Following is the time series plot of the data.",
        "Note!The period of steep increase (and decrease). The authors also note a slight downward trend so examined first differences.  Following is the time series plot of first differences.",
        "Consistent with the original data, we see sharp increases and decreases in certain periods. After some experimentation the authors decided to use separate AR(4) models for two regions: data following a first difference greater than or equal to .05 and data following a first difference less than .05. The model fit well, as evidence by the following plots – the ACF and PACF of the residuals and a plot comparing actual first difference to predicted first differences.  In the plot comparing actual and predicted values, the predicted values are along the red dashed line.",
