        "SYSEN 555 Invention & Creative Design: is a three-credit course that examines invention and design as integral aspects of technical problem-solving through a systems perspective, focusing on “design as a system.” The course is structured around four key elements—Problem, Process, People, and Product—which are explored both individually and in combination to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding design. Students delve into the fundamentals of invention, including topics like patents, while also studying key principles, models, and research findings related to design. Through case studies of designers and inventors, their methods, and the artifacts they create, the course provides an in-depth look at how innovation occurs and is applied in practice.",
        "This course explores invention and design as examples of technical problem-solving from a systems perspective (i.e., design as a system). A framework of four elements (Problem, Process, People, and Product) is used to provide an underlying structure for the course, with the elements investigated separately and in combination. In addition to basic knowledge about invention (e.g., patents), students will study key principles, models, and research findings related to design, as well as case studies of designers and inventors, their methods, and the artifacts they create.",

        "*Subject to change",
        "While invention and design have always been with us in some form, patents are relatively new in the span of human history. In this section, you will learn some basic facts about the “invention” of patents and the legal systems created around them. You will also learn how to distinguish among the basic types of intellectual property protection commonly used today – i.e., copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents – with a chance to test your knowledge at the end of the section. In learning about patents, you will be introduced to the three kinds of patents found in the U.S. patent system, along with the five statutory classes of subject matter considered patentable and the three essential qualities every patentable invention must meet.",
        "(SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE)",
        "The history of invention is both extensive and fascinating, full of many interesting anecdotes and amazing advancements; we could spend an entire course on the historical background of invention alone. For our purposes here, we will satisfy ourselves with just a few key facts that will set the stage for understanding how inventions are protected in the United States. We begin in the 15th century, when the practice of granting exclusive rights to an inventor for a limited time first occurred (as far as we know). The first patent law was established in Venice, Italy, in 1474, where it was utilized by Galileo for an irrigation pump. Other European nations also granted patents in a similar way; the practice was a way for a ruler to reward his (occasionally her) friends for political and/or financial favors. The British Parliament curtailed these abuses in 1624 and defined specific conditions for granting patents to inventors (i.e., the owner and duration of the patent).",
        "Like so many of our regulatory mechanisms, the U.S. patent system was inspired by the British patent system, although no general patent law appeared in the U.S.. until 1790. Prior to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, individual colonies granted patents. Then, within its structure, the authors of the U.S. Constitution placed a clause that granted Congress the authority to establish a patent system, although they did not specifically use that term:",
        "U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 8: “The Congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries.”",
        "Generally speaking, the original purpose and philosophy of the U.S. patent system was to provide a stimulus to industry and to support the development of a budding nation. The subject matter covered by that system was stated to be “any useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement thereon not before known or used”. Moreover, applicants who were interested in applying for a patent were to provide a patent specification and drawing, and if possible, a working model. Figure 1.1. shows a patent granted to Samuel Hopkins of Philadelphia, PA on July 31, 1790. Mr. Hopkins received the first U.S. patent on record for his improvement in “the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process”.",
        "Protecting one’s intellectual property is a bit of a paradoxical challenge: How can a person openly put an idea to use and still retain exclusive rights to the idea? In the United States, intellectual property laws were designed to protect the rights arising from the creative mental work of individuals. Intellectual property refers to products of the mind, which can be protected by the following mechanisms:",
        "(SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Copyrights:",
        "Copyrights protect an author’s creative works (e.g., literary, musical, dramatic, pictorial, movies, computer programs, etc.) from unauthorized copying. It’s important to note that copyrights protect the manner of expression of an idea, not the underlying idea itself. So, for example, two different people can write books about the life of Henry Ford, but they cannot use the same collection of words and artwork in the same arrangement.",
        "Here are a few other things you should know concerning copyrights:",
        "Trademarks:",
        "Trademarks are distinctive words, phrases, names, symbols, or devices used to identify the source of goods in commerce. A trademark is not used to identify the product itself – only the source of the product. So, for example, anyone can manufacture and sell soft drinks (using their own recipe), but only the Coca-Cola® company can put their trademark on a bottle or can. Moreover, trademarks remain in force indefinitely (with renewal every 20 years), provided the mark has not been retired. To register your trademark, you must apply to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which is located in Alexandria, Virginia.",
        "Trade Secrets:",
        "Trade Secrets are confidential information held by industry that are protected under the body of common law (“trade secret law”) governed by the individual states. More importantly, there is no universal agreement on what constitutes a trade secret. Some general examples would be processes, formulas, patterns, devices, or customer lists – anything that gives a company a competitive advantage over another.",
        "Patents:",
        "Now we come to the “main meal” of this lesson: understanding patents. Our key resource for information on patents will be the U.S.. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Make yourself familiar with the USPTO web site: www.uspto.gov. It is an excellent resource for learning about intellectual property, even if you never intend to file for a patent or trademark yourself – and you will use it in completing your course project as well!",
        "A U.S.. patent is granted by the Federal government to an inventor, giving her/him the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling her/his invention in the U.S. for a limited period of time. The key here is the word “exclude”: a patent does not give a person the right to use/sell/practice his or her invention, only to exclude others from doing so. In terms of timeframe, a patent is granted for a period of time that begins on the date of issue and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. Patent applications come not only from individuals, but also from teams and corporations. In fact, only around 15% of U.S. patent applications currently come from independent inventors. This can be attributed to changes in the technical problem solving environment (including the cost of patent applications) and the importance of teams in invention.",
        "Three Types of Patents",
        "There are three types of patentable inventions, leading to three types of patents: utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. The tabbed sections below describe these types and provide examples. In addition to the USPTO web site, you can also search for all three types of patents using the Google patent search web site: patents.google.com.",
        "(SELECT ARROWS TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Utility Patents",
        "As you might expect, utility patents protect “inventions of utility”, where the emphasis is on the functionality of the invention (what does it do). This is the most common type of patent, making up 90% of those granted by the USPTO. An example of a device covered by a utility patent would be a security document with specially encoded data (U.S. Patent #6,546,112 B1) or a machine to produce stamped cookie cutters.",
        "Design Patents",
        "With design patents, the emphasis is on the appearance or aesthetic properties of the invention, rather than its functionality. This is the second most common type of patent granted by the USPTO. An example of an invention covered by a design patent would be a chair supported by a unique type of pedestal rather than four legs or a powder compact for make-up (U.S. Design Patent #D407,853).",
        "Plant Patents",
        "Finally, certain types of plants are covered by plant patents – specifically, plants that are reproduced asexually (i.e., reproduced by means other than from seeds, cuttings, tuber propagation, or grafting). This is the least common type of patent and would cover (for example) specially bred roses or peach trees (U.S. Plant Patent #PP10,872).",
        "Five Classes of Subject Matter",
        "Furthermore, a patentable invention must meet several specific requirements: (1) it must be of a suitable subject matter, and (2) it must exhibit three essential qualities. When it comes to utility patents, there are five statutory classes of subject matter considered patentable, as follows:",
        "Three Essential Qualities",
        "In addition, patentable inventions must exhibit three essential qualities: Novelty, Utility, and Non-Obviousness.",
        "Novelty: To meet the novelty criterion, an invention must not be published or patented anywhere in the world or used/sold in the U.S. more than one year prior to the date of application for a patent. In essence, then, proving novelty means you must show that your idea is sufficiently different from those that came before it. This is done by showing that the product has not appeared in any previously published literature or public distribution setting; demonstrating this is known as searching the prior art.",
        "Utility: To meet the utility requirement, the invention must be useful (serve a useful purpose or function), even if its only function or use is amusement. The assessment of utility is definitely subjective; some patent functions can seem downright silly, like an electronic snore depressor (U.S. Patent #3,480,010A).",
        "Non-Obviousness: To meet the non-obviousness criterion, an invention must not be obvious to people with ordinary skill in the domain of the invention. The assessment here is a bit abstract and subjective, and definitely requires a technical background and familiarity with the prior art. For example, minor changes in material or form are not patentable due to their obviousness.",
        "Non-Patentable Things",
        "Based on the three essential qualities described above, the USPTO has identified several categories of things that cannot be patented. Table 1.3 shows examples of things that are not patentable, along with the relevant reasons.",
        "A Few More Patent Facts",
        "In general, patent systems fall into two categories: first-to-invent and first-to-file. In first-to-invent systems, the first person to invent or “reduce a device to practice” has precedence over anyone else filing a patent application for the same device. In such a system, it is the responsibility of the inventor to prove that he/she created an invention before anyone else – a good reason to keep detailed and dated invention notebooks! In first-to-file systems, the first person to file a patent application for a particular device has precedence. Until 2013, the U.S. patent system was a first-to-invent system. The “America Invents Act”, signed by President Barack Obama on September 16, 2011, switched the U.S. patent system from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013.",
        "In your second reading for this week – Petroski, Ch. 5 (Aluminum Cans and Failure) – you will consider the different kinds of failure that occur in design and invention, and how they influence the resultant emerging patterns of solution development. Many kinds of failure are relevant in our engineering practice, including technical and conceptual failure, among others.",
        "(SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Technical Failure:",
        "Technical failure is the fundamental failure (technological breakdown or malfunction) of a material, device, process, or program. Technical failures can be unintended, leading to an unplanned loss of function in a design or invention (e.g., the collapse of a beam under a heavy load; a programming error). Such unintended technical failures are destructive; we manage these known sources of potential failure within the design process through various mechanisms, including safety factors and scheduled maintenance checks. Interestingly, technical failures can also be purposeful – i.e., they can actually be designed into a product or system as part of its intended technical functionality, such as the physical separation of the metal tab on an aluminum can or the perforated section of a packaging envelope. We might even call this “failure by design”.",
        "Conceptual Failure:",
        "Conceptual failure is the failure of a concept or idea to deliver the desired or promised results, even when the concept is realized perfectly (i.e., an idea doesn’t work out the way we thought it would and/or factors or implementation issues are overlooked). An example would be a new auto body design that promises to be more aerodynamic than a previous model, but upon testing, we find that it is not. Or we may believe that a new toothpaste container will be a huge success in the market, only to find that customers don’t like it once we put it on the grocery store shelves. Or the environmental side effects of a product make it impossible to support, even though it is a technical success.",
        "In closing this section – and this lesson – it is important to consider how failures of any kind impact your own design or invention work. In addition to the obvious technical need to correct any failures that lead to negative consequences, it is also important to consider our psychological and emotional responses to failure in general. If we examine the lives of famous designers and inventors, including Thomas Edison (who once stated: “I have not failed. I have found 10,000 ways that won’t work”), Stephanie Kwolek (inventor of Kevlar), Gordon Murray, and Kenneth Grange, we see that these individuals experienced failure (both technical and conceptual) as much as any other designer/inventor – possibly more so, if Edison’s quote is any indication. We (and they) might say that their success was at least partly a result of their response to those failures: i.e., rather than giving up, they examined their failures closely and then “got back on the horse”, revising their concepts and designs and trying again.",
        "As a final bit of humorous inspiration to help you persist in the face of failure, check out this brief video (“The Roses of Success”) from the famous MGM film, “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”. In it, the kidnaped father of an inventor has been asked to invent a car that will float; his comrades remind him that “from the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success”. Enjoy!",
        "In Lesson 5, you were introduced to different research methods for studying individual designers and inventors, including historical studies and in situ protocol studies. You might now ask yourself: do these same methods apply to studying design teams as well? The answer is ‘yes’, and you will soon see several examples from different sources, including your textbook (Cross) and the review of a recent design research study taken from the scholarly literature.",
        "(SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE)",
        "In Chapter 5 of your textbook (Cross), you observed a lone, highly experienced designer (Victor Scheinman) applying his expert knowledge to the design of a bike rack in a think-aloud protocol study. In the first part of this week’s readings (Cross, Chapter 6), you will observe a team of three experienced designers attacking exactly the same design problem (i.e., designing a new bike rack) – but in this case, rather than a think-aloud experiment, all of the team’s actions and natural conversation were recorded and analyzed closely in a variety of ways. In particular, the roles and relationships of the team members were examined, as well as their approach to planning and changing activities, gathering and sharing information, generating and adopting concepts, and avoiding and resolving conflicts. Among other results, this study confirmed that teams of designers engage in both a technical process and a social process, so their interactions, personal roles, and relationships cannot be ignored as they pursue their scientific solutions. Finally, in the last part of this week’s readings (Cross, Chapter 7), you will explore a comparison of these two studies (i.e., Scheinman vs. the design team) that includes a fascinating analysis of how much time Scheinman and the team, respectively, spent in the principal phases of their design processes (clarifying the task, searching for concepts, and fixing their final concept). As you read through these chapters, reflect on your experiences in designing things – both alone and with others – and look for insights into how your experiences were similar and different from these studies.",
        "We move now to a more recent research study involving design teams. Our aims here are twofold: (1) to add depth to your experience with design team research in general; and (2) to explore a study that integrates some of the topics you have learned in this and other courses in your degree program. The research we will briefly examine grew out of a collaborative project between Penn State University and Stanford University researchers. The work was sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and focused on mapping the high performance design team “genome” – i.e., identifying key factors that lead to design team success by exploring the relationships between individual designer characteristics, team interaction behavior, and design performance outcomes (see Figure 6.4).",
        "Several scholarly references related to this project can be found at the end of this lesson; each one is a typical example of design team research that takes a mixed methods approach (i.e., both quantitative and qualitative analyses). While you are not required to read any of these articles for this course, you may find them interesting as a supplement to your studies. Here, we’ll review just a few details taken from the first of the listed references (Jablokow, et al., 2019, ASEE), separating our review into three sections:",
        "(SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Research Aims and Methods",
        "To provide some context for this brief review, all of the design teams under observation were existing teams at the time of the study. These particular teams were enrolled in an entrepreneurship program that aimed to helped design teams move their design concepts beyond prototyping and into actual practice by applying a user-centered design approach. Each team was fairly multidisciplinary (i.e., different types of engineering or science, with some business background) and contained both students and faculty members from the same mid-Western university. Each team also included a senior mentor, who was assigned by the program organizers to help guide the team as it worked through the entrepreneurial design process.",
        "Within this context, the underlying research aims for the study were focused on making the teams more effective, improving the assignment process for mentors, and enhancing each team’s activities throughout the design process through a better understanding of the individual cognitive characteristics and dynamic interactions of the teams. To this end, the research team collected data from the design teams via a 1-day workshop; the flow of the workshop is shown in Figure 6.5.",
        "The workshop began with a brief background presentation about the research study; each participant also signed a consent form prior to further participation. At the end of the background presentation, each individual completed the KAI inventory (the same one you completed in SYSEN 550). Following these introductory activities, all design teams were presented with the same real-world design challenge focused on the development of an inexpensive water pump for a developing country and given one hour to complete their work. Team deliverables included two prototypes made of simple craft materials: (1) a Best Fit prototype (readily seen to meet the design specifications) and (2) a Dark Horse prototype (a potentially riskier solution that might not be feasible), as well as a brief presentation.",
        "The research team video-recorded each design team’s interactions as they developed and presented their solutions; the KAIs were scored as they worked. Following the first design challenge, each participant completed an individual debrief document. Next, the research team described how the videos would be analyzed (i.e., via IDN – the Interaction Dynamics Notation) and delivered a short KAI feedback session, in which each person received his/her KAI results. This presentation was followed by a second design challenge focused on addressing the social isolation experienced by some children in hospitals. Once again, two prototyped solutions (Best Fit and Dark Horse) were requested, each team’s interactions and presentations were recorded, and the same debrief document was administered at the end of the experience.",
        "As a quick aside, the method for analyzing the videos involved the application of the Interaction Dynamics Notation (IDN), which was developed at Stanford University by one of the authors of this paper (N. Sonalkar) based on cognitive semiotics and improvisational theater. Using IDN, researchers can record the interpersonal interactions of team members and map those interactions to specific IDN symbols and sequences, as shown in Figures 6.6 and 6.7. Those interaction sequences can then be analyzed using statistical techniques, data mining, and other methods. In addition to IDN sequences, this research team also analyzed the ideation utterances for each design team (i.e., number of ideas, number of unique ideas).",
        "Design team outcomes were observed and analyzed in a number of ways. The outcome data collected by the research team included the design prototypes of each team (Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions), individual reflections on the design experiences, and individual perceptions of both personal and team performance. See Figure 6.8 for examples taken from the debrief survey of one participant.",
        "Findings from the Study",
        "Now let’s look at a few of the findings from this study (full details can be found in the referenced conference paper).",
        "(SELECT ARROWS TO LEARN MORE)",
        "Finding #1:",
        "All of the design teams showed high cognitive style diversity, with innovative style means. This finding is not surprising for a self-proclaimed “entrepreneurship” program in which teams self-select to participate. Other studies related to KAI have shown that entrepreneurs (as a population) tend to have more innovative cognitive styles on average, although more adaptive individuals can clearly succeed as entrepreneurs as well. Interestingly, this research team also found that coping behavior was low across all of the design teams, despite their high cognitive diversity.",
        "Finding #2:The most successful design teams in this study all contained well-positioned “bridgers” in terms of cognitive style. In other words, the teams who exhibited the best design results (e.g., most ideas generated, most proactive in engaging with users) had at least one team member who was “mid-way” (approximately) between the most adaptive and most innovative members of the team. Team reflections indicate that this bridging team member often served as a moderator for the team (even when they were not the team’s formal mentor).",
        "Finding #3:",
        "Variations in individual team members’ perceptions of their team outcomes were unrelated to cognitive style (KAI). Here, the finding refers to how individual team members evaluated the novelty, usefulness, and feasibility of their Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions (see Figure 6.9). One might hypothesize that the more adaptive and more innovative participants in the study would rate their Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions differently in terms of these three metrics, but the results of the study show otherwise. In general, as you can see in the figure, the Best Fit solutions of all the teams were generally evaluated as less novel but more feasible and more useful than the Dark Horse solutions.",
        "Implications of the StudyThe research we have briefly reviewed here has implications for both design practitioners and engineering educators. Among other things, it shows that cognitive characteristics can be used in composing teams to enable the “bridging effect” within the team and to improve the mentor matching process. It also shows that design teamwork can be explicitly investigated and understood using KAI and IDN. And finally, it confirms that the awareness of team interaction patterns and cognitive styles can help design teams identify sequences and behaviors that lead to more design ideas and to better regulation of their own performance.",

        "The SYSEN 555: Invention & Creative Design course provides students with a comprehensive foundation in invention and creative problem-solving, critical for advancing careers in industries driven by innovation, such as technology, manufacturing, and design. The course’s focus on ideation, prototyping, and iterative testing equips students with practical experience that directly applies to real-world product development. By learning to think creatively and work collaboratively, students improve their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, enhancing their potential to work in roles like product manager, industrial designer, innovation consultant, or development engineer. Furthermore, the course’s attention to patenting and intellectual property opens doors for careers in patent law and product protection.",
        "A real-world example of how the SYSEN 555: Invention & Creative Design course applies to industry can be seen in the development of innovative consumer products, like the creation of the Fitbit. The process of designing and developing the Fitbit required extensive research, ideation, prototyping, and testing—key concepts taught in the course. Designers and engineers worked together in teams to understand the user’s needs (empathize), define the problem (define), brainstorm ideas (ideate), and create prototypes that could be tested with real users. Throughout this process, they iterated on their design based on user feedback and market trends, much like the design thinking approach students learn in this course. By learning these skills in SYSEN 555, students gain the practical knowledge needed to contribute to similar product development projects, whether in consumer technology, healthcare devices, or other industries where creative design and innovation are essential.",
