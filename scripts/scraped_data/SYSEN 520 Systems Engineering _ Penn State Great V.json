        "A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). The following grading system applies to graduate students:",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95 – 100, A- = 90 – 94, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 84- 86, B- = 80 – 83, C+ = 77 – 79, C = 70 – 76, D = 60 – 69, and F = below 60.",
        "There are five (5) individual homework assignments. Due dates will be specified in the assignments and course schedule. Homework will constitute 30% of your final grade. Doing the homework promptly and carefully is necessary for learning the material. Collaboration with fellow students is allowed and encouraged on homework. However, each student must turn in his or her own work which reflects his or her own understanding of the material. Format for submitting homework is specified in the assignment. Homework is expected to be submitted on time, however, it may be submitted late without penalty with PRIOR approval from the instructor.",
        "There are four weekly discussion forum assignments. Due dates are specified in the discussion forum and course schedule. Weekly discussion forum participation will constitute 20% of your final grade (5% for each of the four weekly discussion forum assignments). Each forum requires at least TWO posts.",
        "The initial post will be completed by each group by Thursday at 11:59pm of the assigned week. Then, each student must individually post a substantive comment or question on other groups’ posts by Friday at 11:59pm of that week.",
        "The main deliverable of this project is a System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) document which you and your group will produce. The document covers activities and milestones necessary to technically manage design and development of the given system. The group project will constitute 20% of your final grade. Please read the Group Project Description in Lesson 1 for a detailed description. Projects are due on the date assigned in the Course Schedule. If you have a legitimate reason for not completing the project on time, please email well in advance of the due date for the project.",
        "When completing group work, your team may choose any method of collaboration or communication that is most effective.  Zoom is available to all students for multi-person video meetings.  If you need any assistance using Zoom, refer to the Conferencing and Media Management page or contact the World Campus Helpdesk for support.",
        "The midterm exam will constitute 30% of your final grade.  The midterm exam is open-book and open-notes. The mid-exam is to be completed without assistance from other students (current or past) on an individual basis. Any questions on the exam should be directed to your instructor.",
