        "ACCTG 831: Advanced Auditing is designed to prepare students for leadership roles in the evolving field of auditing by delving into contemporary issues, advanced auditing techniques, and case-based analysis. This course builds on foundational principles, focusing on integrated auditing of financial statements and internal controls, continuous auditing practices, and assurance services for nonfinancial information. Students will gain practical insights into auditing computer-based systems and learn to evaluate system controls and data integrity using advanced auditing software. Topics such as forensic accounting and fraud detection equip students with the skills to identify and prevent financial misrepresentation, while expert systems in accounting highlight the transformative role of technology as a key audit tool.",
        "Through engaging case studies, hands-on learning, and exploration of cutting-edge auditing technologies, this course positions students to excel in critical roles such as external auditor, internal auditor, and forensic accountant. Whether you’re aiming to address challenges in corporate accountability, detect and prevent fraud, or secure the integrity of accounting systems, ACCTG 831 provides the knowledge and tools needed to thrive in today’s technology-driven accounting landscape. With a strong emphasis on applying auditing standards and practices to real-world scenarios, this course ensures that graduates are equipped to make a lasting impact in the field.",
        "This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of fundamental auditing concepts and philosophies, the environment in which auditing and assurance services are performed, and the methods for accumulating and interpreting audit evidence while documenting results. Students will explore the application of professional standards to real-world situations faced by accountants, as well as the processes involved in completing audit work and issuing an audit report.",
        "By the end of the course, students should:",
        "There are two required textbooks:",
        "*Additional student resources for the auditing cases: https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/bp/bridgepages/bp_beasley_bridgepage/7e/.",
        "Please remember that ALL questions about grades, course lesson content, and assignments should be directed to your course instructor. If you have any technical difficulties using the tools within this course, please contact the Penn State Helpdesk.",
        "All course-related e-mails should go through Canvas’s course mail function (Canvas Inbox). Using Canvas to contact your instructor ensures that your message will be read, and your instructor will respond to you in a timely manner.",
        "Many of the University Libraries’ resources can be utilized from a distance. Through the Library website, you can access magazines, journals and articles; borrow materials and have them delivered to your doorstep; and get research help via email chat or phone from a librarian.",
        "For more information, view the Penn State University Library website.",
        "A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). Students are encouraged to seek the instructor’s input during the process of completing each course requirement. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments. The following grading system applies to graduate students:",
        "*Note: Students are reminded that simply meeting the minimal requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content and presentation) will result in a letter grade of “B‐” for that assignment.",
        "*Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 96-100, A- = 90-95, B+ = 87-89, B = 84-86, B- = 80-83, C+ = 77-79, C = 70-76, D = 60-69, F = Below 60",
        "Course materials will be distributed through the Canvas website. Since this course is a seminar-style course, all are expected to participate in class discussions. Unexcused absence from class will cost five points of the participation grade. Your grade for participation will not only reflect how often you contributed to our class discussions but also the quality of your contributions. Quality contributions to class discussions are constructive in nature and generate a further response(s) from your fellow classmates. You need to thoroughly understand the cases to be presented in each class and be ready to discuss them in class. Combative posturing, defamatory remarks, or statements that are off-topic work to silence others and stunt dialogue and will, therefore, negatively impact your participation grade. Please see me early on in the semester outside of class to discuss ways to effectively participate in our seminar if you are concerned about your performance in this regard.  The instructor has the sole discretion to determine this. At the end of each class, I will notify you of your participation progress through Canvas or emails. There are 30 total participation points possible in this course.",
        "At each residential meeting, students are required to present audit cases from the book: Auditing Cases: An Interactive Learning Approach. Case assignments will be determined at the beginning of the course. In each 25-30 minute presentation, you need to briefly introduce the case, lead the discussion of the questions, offer your solutions, and summarize the discussions. Your PowerPoint slides should be emailed to the instructor two days before each meeting when you will present.",
        "Each student is randomly assigned an auditing-related topic and is expected to conduct independent research to answer those questions related to that topic. The final project should be properly cited, double-spaced Word document. No specific manual style is needed. Late submission of up to one day will be accepted with a 40% penalty. No acceptance of late submission after one day extension.",
        "*subject to change",
        "A career in accounting, particularly with expertise gained through courses like ACCTG 831: Advanced Auditing, opens doors to a variety of impactful and rewarding professional opportunities. This course equips students with advanced knowledge of auditing principles, professional standards, and the complexities of the assurance services environment. By mastering the skills to evaluate and interpret audit evidence, apply professional judgment, and navigate ethical considerations, graduates are well-prepared to pursue roles such as external or internal auditors, forensic accountants, and compliance officers. These positions are critical in ensuring organizational accountability, safeguarding financial integrity, and fostering trust in business practices.",
        "The advanced auditing knowledge gained in ACCTG 831 also enhances career prospects in leadership and consulting roles. As organizations face increasingly complex regulatory requirements and financial risks, the ability to design and execute effective audit strategies becomes invaluable. Graduates can leverage their expertise to advance in roles such as audit managers, risk analysts, or even chief financial officers. Additionally, the emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving, and adherence to professional standards in this course positions students as key contributors to their organizations, enabling them to shape sound financial policies and practices while maintaining public trust.",
        "A student with a degree in Accounting and expertise gained from ACCTG 831: Advanced Auditing would work on projects that directly address the complexities of auditing in today’s financial and regulatory environment. For example, they might lead an internal audit for a Fortune 500 company to ensure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requirements, examining financial statements, evaluating internal controls, and identifying areas for improvement. This type of project demonstrates the critical role of auditors in maintaining financial integrity and mitigating organizational risk.",
        "Another real-world project could involve conducting a forensic audit to investigate fraud or financial misconduct within a corporation or government agency. This could include analyzing complex financial data to uncover discrepancies, preparing detailed reports for legal proceedings, and offering recommendations to strengthen fraud prevention measures. Additionally, students might work on a comprehensive audit engagement for a public accounting firm, assessing client compliance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to issue accurate and transparent audit reports. These examples highlight how the skills developed in ACCTG 831 prepare graduates for impactful and high-stakes roles in the accounting profession.",
