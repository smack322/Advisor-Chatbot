        "BUSAD 523 : Prices and Markets focuses on the application of economic principles to key managerial decisions, helping students understand the economic factors that influence daily business operations. The course covers essential concepts such as marginal analysis, present value analysis, supply and demand, agency theory, and game theory. By using these frameworks, students will develop critical decision-making skills, enabling them to address real-world challenges like pricing strategies, employee management, and maximizing profitability. This course also provides foundational knowledge beneficial to other MBA courses, particularly in finance, marketing, and business strategy, ensuring students are equipped for effective management in various organizational contexts.",
        "Managers make many economic decisions every day. How many employees should be hired, how they should be monitored, what price should be charged for the firm’s product to reach firm objectives, how to maximize profitability, and so on are some of the questions managers deal with every day.",
        "Managerial Economics is concerned with the application of economic principles and methodologies to key management decisions within organizations. It provides principles to foster the goals of the organization, as well as a better understanding of the external business environment in which an organization operates. Managerial Economics is fundamentally a unique way of thinking about problems, issues and decisions that managers face at the functional as well as the strategic levels, and this course provides students with theoretical concepts and frameworks such as marginal analysis, present value analysis, supply and demand, agency theory, game theory, and so on and help them develop rational decision-making skills.",
        "A primary purpose of the course is to develop tools useful in other MBA courses since economics is the foundation for much of what is taught in finance, marketing, business strategy and many other courses in the MBA program.",

Students are encouraged to respectfully challenge their own, each others, and the instructor’s views.  The classroom is a cooperative learning environment where students are encouraged to help each other learn the course materials.",
        "The fact that classes are scheduled is evidence that the faculty believes class instruction is important. Therefore, class attendance is important for the benefit of students. Accordingly, it is the policy of the University that class attendance by students be encouraged and that all instructors organize and conduct their courses with this policy in mind. A student should attend every class for which the student is scheduled and should be held responsible for all work covered in the courses taken. In each case, the instructor should decide when the class absence constitutes a danger to the student’s scholastic attainment and should make this fact known to the student at once. A student whose irregularity in attendance causes the student, in the judgment of the instructor, to become deficient scholastically may run the risk of receiving a failing grade or receiving a lower grade than the student might have secured had the student been in regular attendance.",
