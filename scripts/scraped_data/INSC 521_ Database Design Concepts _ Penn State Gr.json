        "A few basic reminders, harking back to your Online Orientation:",
        "*Subject to change",
        "The most common concept related to storing data is a “database”. Merriam Webster dictionary defines a database as: “a usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval (as by a computer)”. So, according to this definition, any collection of related data constitutes a database – including file cabinets, text files, Excel files, Access databases, and so on.",
        "This is contrary to the common understanding of the concept in technical circles that associate the concept of a database to Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase. These systems are relational database management systems but people just call them databases. The emergence of database systems was a crucial development in providing accurate and timely information to managers.",
        "A database is a collection of data sets that are related to domain or subject and that are processed for extracting information using an application system. However, a database system is much more than data, or data in combination with database management software. It is comprised of hardware, software, data, and people.",
        "It is important to note when someone buys the latest Oracle product seeking to develop a database for a specific purpose, Oracle does not deliver a solution for that problem (set of tables, indexes, etc.). Rather, they deliver a framework that facilitates efficient storage of the business-related data. This framework is known as a database management system (DBMS) and has the purpose of facilitating the creation of databases. A DBMS manipulates the database and appropriate hardware and personnel.  A DBMS is usually purchased from a software vendor and is an application program or the tool an end-user uses to view and manipulate data in the database.",
        "The image in Figure 1.1 shows such an example for an Oracle DBMS. In this case, starting a database means starting some processes in an Oracle instance that will facilitate the access of users to a database stored in data files in an Oracle readable format. Essentially, a DBMS facilitates access to files that may be otherwise accessed by other similar products.",
        "So, in theory, we could develop a DBMS that could use comma-separated variable files as the underlying storage. Why don’t we? Well, there are many advantages to using DBMS applications, ranging from security to redundancy control, or from efficiency to concurrency. For a complete answer to this question, please read Section 1.6 in your textbook to find a complete list of advantages of databases over other methods of data storage.",
        "However, a closer look into using a DBMS application to manage and store information would reveal some drawbacks. One of the most important drawbacks is the “Danger to Overkill”, which relates to small and simple applications with small quantity and diverse data serviced by a small number of users. This is the case for all those applications that do not need a lot of aggregations to be interpreted, and for which the lifespan of information is short.",
        "For example, a shopping list application may not need a database because we rarely care about what we bought last month.",
        "Often these applications use simple files to store data and retrieve it with SQL Lite when installed on devices such as smartphones. Generally speaking, the time, knowledge, and resource commitment can be high when using DMBSs. For example, the installer for Oracle Client 12c is 925 megabytes in size, which is up from ~500 megabytes for Oracle 10.2. This, together with proper setup procedures, makes it difficult to set up for small projects.",
        "Normalization refers to rigorous standards for good design, designed formally, and methods for testing a database design. A good design practice should avoid redundancy as much as possible. Many times, databases are hidden from the user by an application layer and for that reason, many people consider database design as a secondary task. Table 6.1 below shows an example of poor database design:",

        "Let’s Look at Some Of The Problems With Table 6.1:",
        "Repeating Groups:",
        "The course name and instructor are repeated for each class. If a student needs a third class, you need to go back and modify the table design to record it. While you could add CourseID3, CourseID4, CourseID5, etc., along with the associated description and instructor fields, no matter how far you take it there may one day be someone who wants one more class. Additionally, adding all those fields when most students would never use them is a waste of storage.",
        "Inconsistent Data:Let’s say that after entering these rows, you discover that Bill Ocean’s course is titled “Advanced Visual Basic”. To reflect this change, you would need to examine all the rows and change each individually. This introduces the potential for errors if one of the changes is omitted or done incorrectly.",

        "If you no longer wished to track Billy Idol Intro to DAO class, you would need to delete two students, two advisors, and one additional instructor to do it. If you remove the first two rows of the table, all the data is deleted with the reference to the course.",
