        "MATH 2360 is a non-credit bridge course designed to prepare students for advanced studies in machine learning and related fields by building a strong foundation in linear algebra and its applications. Divided into five comprehensive modules—Systems of Linear Equations, Matrix Algebra, Vectors, Determinants, and Linear Transformations—the course emphasizes essential mathematical concepts that underpin modern machine learning techniques. Students will work independently through each module, engaging with customized content crafted by expert faculty in the Engineering Department.",
        "The course is delivered via a specially tailored zyBook, providing interactive content and activities to reinforce key concepts. Each module concludes with an assessment designed to measure understanding and mastery of the material. By completing this course, students will not only gain the mathematical tools necessary for machine learning but also develop problem-solving skills essential for success in advanced academic and professional pursuits.",
        "This course is designed to bridge the gap that students might have in programming as an introduction to fundamental concepts of programming and the Python programming language. The concepts include basic computational constructs found in imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming languages such as iteration, conditionals, functions, recursion, and data types. Students will learn how to design and develop fully functional programs in Python using commonly used data structures, user-defined functions, classes, modules, and files. Emphasis is on good software engineering principles. Python is used as a case study as it has been voted as the number one programming language by IEEE and by the Tiobe index since 2021.",
        "Each topic is presented by introducing the concept, explaining how the problem is solved, and practicing programming examples. One of the lasting effects of the course is the specification, design, and implementation experience. The improved ability to reason about programs is also important. But perhaps most important of all is the exposure to Python modules that are easily used in many situations. The students no longer have to write everything from scratch. As Python is used as a case study, students are thinking about a problem, and they will suddenly realize that a large chunk of the work can be done relying on what they developed in this course. They will get acquainted with using the familiar constructs from a library of Python modules.",

        "Students will be evaluated on their understanding of the course material by completing eleven (11) weekly assignments that evaluate their understanding of and ability to apply material contained in the lectures and reading assignments. One cumulative final exam will evaluate their knowledge of the Python language and program design principles, Final Grades will be calculated as follows:",
        "There will be five zyBooks assignments.  Each assignment will include readings, exercises, and practice activities. Although these assignments are not graded, you are expected to complete them in the order they are listed to ensure that you fully comprehend all of the concepts presented.",
        "You will complete an assessment at the end of each Module in the form of a multiple-choice quiz. You must score at least 80% to advance to the next Module.",

        "One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering.",
        "To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering.",
