        "SWENG 585: Pattern-Oriented Design is a three-credit course that immerses you in the art and science of object-oriented software design. Focused on building flexible, reusable, and high-quality systems, this course covers essential principles such as Riel’s design heuristics, Martin’s class and package design principles, and the “Gang of Four” design pattern catalog. You’ll also explore techniques for refactoring and strategies for evolving software frameworks, equipping you with skills that go beyond the classroom and directly into professional practice.",
        "Designed for hands-on learning, the course offers opportunities to tackle real-world design challenges through a collaborative project, where you will develop a comprehensive design document that reflects industry standards. By simulating real stakeholder interactions and applying proven patterns, you’ll gain valuable experience in crafting software that adapts to changing needs. Whether you’re advancing your career or aiming to master best practices in software development, SWENG 585 will empower you to design innovative solutions with confidence.",
        "(3 credits) This course studies the heuristics, principles, and patterns of object-oriented design in the construction of extendable frameworks, reusable packages, and pluggable components.",
        "Building upon the introductory course in object-oriented analysis and design, this class explains the issues and means in designing software systems for reuse and extension. Students will understand how to leverage the powers of object-orientation embodied in well-known heuristics, principles and patterns in the design and construction of reusable frameworks, packages and components. In general terms, the intent of this class is to introduce the initiatives, techniques and strategies that characterize the efforts made in both academia and industry to transition the software engineering discipline from an ad hoc, random-behavior, random-result “alchemy” into an established profession using repeatable practices with predictable results.",

        "Hoc exemplum textus est quod in hac sectione adhibetur. Plenum est scientiae et cognitionis, quae discipulum informat. Propositum eius est adiuvari discendi processum per utilem informationem praebendam.",
        "There is one (1) exam for this course, which is proctored via Honorlock Proctoring (an online proctoring software).",
        "A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). The following grading system applies to graduate students:",
        "Note: Students are reminded that simply meeting the minimal requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content and presentation) will result in a letter grade of “B‐” for that assignment.",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 94 – 100, A- = 90 – 93, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 84 – 86, B- = 80 – 83, C+ = 77 – 79, C = 70 – 76, D = 60 – 69, and F = Below 60.",
        "There are 5 graded group discussion forums in this course (4 points each). This is a small group discussion (you will be assigned randomly to a group).",
        "Note: There is a general discussion forum where you can ask any questions you have of me. You can email me directly about personal issues, but you should post content related questions to your group forums so that you can all learn together. If you send me email questions that I think would be useful to the class, I will post them there and answer them for all to see.",
        "The individual homework assignments are explained at the conclusion of each lesson. These assignments are performed individually.",
        "The final exam is administered in the final week of the course and is a timed exam that will assess your understanding of the material covered in the course. You will have to choose a period in that final week when you can devote up to 2 hours.",
        "*subject to change",
        "“Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.”",
        "To state it another way: A user of a base class should continue to function properly if a derivative of that base class is passed to it.  Read about Liskov’s Substitution Principle.*",
        "You might think that this is the advantage of inheritance – that a client can have a reference to any instance of any derived class of the base class it expects, but as has been mentioned several times in this course already, we don’t (usually) get type conformance by default…i.e. inheritance does not ensure substitutivity. By the way, this principle is named for Barbara Liskov and I’ve included an article of hers in the Handouts folder that you should read. It provides the formal foundation of the principle.",
        "Consider function, foo(B& b). If I send a reference to an instance of class D derived from B to function foo the compiler will accept it and it wont create a runtime error, but it might not work as I hoped. If D causes foo to misbehave, D is fragile in the presence of foo.",
        "To avoid that problem we might resort to run-time type information, but this still violates LSP and now also OCP.",
        "void DrawShape(const Shape& s){if (typeid(s) == typeid(Square))DrawSquare(static_cast(s));else if (typeid(s) == typeid(Circle))DrawCircle(static_cast(s));}",
        "As you can see from the timeline, frameworks develop from experience and start life as white-box frameworks utilizing inheritance. The persistence framework was an example of a white-box framework through its use of template and factory methods.",
        "As the framework evolves the elements within it are decomposed, regions of variation are identified (Pree’s hotspots) and isolated, and composition and delegation are used in place of inheritance so that those fine-grained elements can be combined by the application developer as needed. Read about each pattern in detail, including the problem it solves, the rationale and context, and the solution and its implementation in the original article here.",
        "The creational patterns are all concerned (unsurprisingly) with object creation. Most of them provide ways to create objects without knowing exactly what you’re creating beyond the interfaces supported by the created objects.",
        "By the end of this course, students will be able to:",
        "During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.",
