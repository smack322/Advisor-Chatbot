        "The data mining task is a complex process that includes, in general, three stages:",
        "Each of these stages may involve multiple steps with some of these steps optional.",
        "A traditional data mining architecture provides a framework for several methods of data exploration and preprocessing. Among the tasks used in data exploration we enumerate:",
        "The model building phase involves the development of a predictive and or descriptive model based on the application of machine learning algorithms. These models are constructed to identify generalized patterns from the intrinsic patterns stored in the data.",
        "The deployment phase involves the application of the model generated to perform decision making. This is an important phase where profiling and user modeling are then applied to life situations. Simplistic applications of data mining tend to merely employ the model to predict the likelihood of events, occurrences, based largely on past patterns. Amazon, for example, can recommend books according to a user’s profile. Similarly, network operators are able to track fraudulent activities in the usage of phone lines, by tracking deviation patterns as compared to standard usage characterization.",
        "To mine association rules in Knime, one needs to install the “Knime Itemset Mining” Extension. To do this, click Help -> Install new software, and then search “Knime Itemset Mining”. The workflow for association rule mining is shown below:",
        "To mine association rules in Knime, we need to have the data in a table with the following format. {Transaction, Item}",
        "An example of input data is shown below.",
        "To make data appropriate for rule mining, we need to convert it to a collection type data. We can do this using a “GroupBy” node with the following setting:",
        "The result of this node will be a dataset with the following structure:",
        "With this data format, we can generate frequent itemsets. The setting of the node is as shown below.",
        "The resulting itemsets are as shown below:",
        "Further, association rules can be generated with the “Association rule learner”. The resulting rules have the following form:",
        "Distributed/Collective Data Mining",
        "One area of data mining that is attracting a good amount of attention is that of distributed and collective data mining. Much of the data mining which is being done currently focuses on a single database, data warehouse, or storage cluster that is managed by a unique entity. However, the situation arises where information may be located in different places and be owned by multiple agents. This is known generally as distributed data mining. Therefore, the goal is to effectively mine distributed data which is located in heterogeneous sites. Examples of this include biological information, data which comes from the databases of two different companies from the related area of business, or analysis of data from different branches of a corporation. For all these examples combining data is considered an expensive and time-consuming process.",
        "Distributed data mining is used to offer a different approach to traditional approaches analysis, by using a combination of localized data analysis tools, together with a global data model and aggregator of local results. In more specific terms, this is specified as performing local data analysis for generating partial data models, and-combining the local data models from different data sites to develop the global model. This global model combines the results of the separate analyses. Often the global model produced, especially if the data in different locations have different features or characteristics, may become incorrect or ambiguous. This problem is especially critical when the data in distributed sites are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous.",
        "Ubiquitous Data Mining",
        "The increased usage of laptops, tablets, cell phones, and wearable computers is making ubiquitous access to a large quantity of data possible. Advanced analysis for extracting useful knowledge from data on such devices is an obvious step in the world of ubiquitous computing. Accessing and analyzing data from a ubiquitous computing device offer many challenges. For example, ubiquitous data mining introduces additional costs due to communication, computation, security, and other factors. So one of its objectives is to mine data while minimizing the cost of ubiquitous presence.",
        "Human-computer interaction is another challenging aspect of ubiquitous data mining. Visualizing patterns like classifiers, clusters, associations, and others, in portable devices are usually difficult. The small display areas offer serious challenges to interactive data mining environments. Data management in a mobile environment is also a challenging issue. Moreover, the sociological and psychological aspects of the integration between data mining technology and our lifestyle are yet to be explored. The key issues to consider when addressing ubiquitous data mining in into the area of algorithms customization for mobile and distributed applications, data management issues, mark-up languages and other data representation techniques, development of database applications for mobile environments, solving architectural issues, location management issues and advances in web-based applications.",
        "Hypertext and Hypermedia Data Mining",
        "Hypertext and hypermedia data mining include mining of text, hyperlinks, mark-ups, and various other forms of hypermedia information. It is closely related to both web mining, and multimedia mining. While the World Wide Web is substantially composed of hypertext and hypermedia elements, there are other kinds of hypertext/hypermedia data sources which are not found on the web. Examples of these include the information found in online catalogs, digital libraries, online information databases, etc. Some of the important data mining techniques used for hypertext and hypermedia data mining include classification, clustering, semi-structured learning, and social network analysis.",
        "One application of classification is in the area of web topic directories, which can group similar sounding or spelled terms into appropriate categories so that searches will not bring up inappropriate sites and pages. The use of classification can also result in searches which are not only based on keywords, but also on category and classification attributes. Unsupervised learning could help group documents by their content which would result in more similar documents being placed closer when displayed to the end user. Semi-supervised learning and social network analysis are other methods which are important to hypermedia based data mining. Semi-supervised learning is the case where there are both labeled and unlabeled documents, and there is a need to learn from both types of documents. Social network analysis is also applicable because the web is considered a social network, which examines networks formed through collaborative association, whether it be between friends, academics doing research or service on committees, and between papers through references and citations.",
        "Multimedia Data Mining",
        "Multimedia Data Mining is the mining and analysis of various types of multimedia data, including images, video, audio, and animation. Multimedia data mining incorporates areas of text mining, as well as hypertext/hypermedia mining as these fields, are closely related. Multimedia information, because of its nature as a large collection of multimedia objects, must be represented differently from conventional forms of data. One approach is to create a multimedia data cube which can be used to convert multimedia-type data into a form which is suited to analysis using one of the main data mining techniques but taking into account the unique characteristics of the data. This may include the use of measures and dimensions for texture, shape, color, and related attributes. In essence, it is possible to create a multidimensional spatial database. Another developing area in multimedia data mining is that of audio data mining. The idea is basically to use audio signals to indicate the patterns of data or to represent the features of data mining results. The basic advantage of audio data mining is that while using a technique such as visual data mining may disclose interesting patterns from observing graphical displays, it does require users to concentrate on watching patterns, which can become monotonous.",
        "Spatial and Geographic Data Mining",
        "Spatial data mining has a unique characteristic of including extra information which is of an entirely different kind: objects are related by their spatial and geographic location. Much of this data is image-oriented and can represent a great deal of information if properly analyzed and mined. Spatial data mining involves the extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relationships, or other patterns not explicitly stored in spatial databases. Some of the components of spatial data which differentiate it from other kinds include distance and topological information, which can be indexed using multidimensional structures, and which requires special spatial data access methods, together with spatial knowledge representation. Analyzing spatial and geographic data include tasks such as understanding and browsing spatial data, uncovering relationships between spatial data items, or analysis on spatial databases and spatial knowledge bases. The applications of these would be useful in such fields as remote sensing, medical imaging, navigation, and related uses. Some of the challenges in constructing a spatial data warehouse include the difficulties of integration of data from heterogeneous sources, and also the usage of on-line analytical processing which is not only relatively fast, but also offers some forms of flexibility.",
        "Time Series/Sequence Data Mining",
        "Another important area in data mining centers on the mining of time series and sequence-based data. This involves the mining of a sequence of data, which can either be referenced by time or by other means. In general, one aspect of mining time series data focuses on the goal of identifying trends or components which exist within the data. These can include long-term trend movements, seasonal variations, cyclical variations, and random variations. Another task I time series is a similarity search and tries to identify a pattern sequence that is identical or similar to a given pattern.",
        "Constraint-Based Data Mining",
        "Many of the current data mining techniques lack the benefit of any guidance or user control. One method of implementing some form of human interaction into data mining is in the form of constraint-based data mining. This form of data mining incorporates the use of constraints that guide the process. There are several categories of constraints that can be used, each of which has its own characteristics and purpose, such as:",
        "Subject-Based Data Mining",
        "Subject-based data mining is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. It is very useful in the context of combating terrorism. Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other data that is considered to be of high interest, based on some predefined information. It has the goal to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements are related to that initiating datum.",
        "The objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles and practical applications of data mining techniques. Students will learn to:",
