        "ACCT 512: Financial Accounting Theory and Reporting Problems is a three-credit course that provides a deep dive into the principles and applications of financial accounting, focusing on the needs of external users of accounting information. Rather than training students to produce accounting data, this course emphasizes the interpretation, evaluation, and effective use of financial information for decision-making.",
        "Through engaging readings, case studies, and practical exercises, the course explores foundational accounting principles and their real-world applications. Students will gain critical insights into the uses—and potential misuses—of financial accounting information while learning techniques to analyze a firm’s financial position. Key topics include revenue recognition, expense recording, cash flow statements, inventory, long-term assets, income taxes, liabilities, employee compensation, and intercorporate investments.",
        "By the end of the course, students will have developed the analytical skills necessary to interpret complex financial reports, evaluate a firm’s financial health, and make informed decisions based on accounting data—an essential skill set for careers in finance, management, and consulting.",
        "Financial Accounting Theory and Reporting Problems is a three (3) credit course that introduces students to financial accounting, which focuses on external users of accounting information. The course will focus on the basic principles underlying financial accounting and specific applications of those principles. Throughout the course, we will focus on the uses (and potential misuses) of financial accounting information. We will also discuss some common techniques used to analyze a firm’s financial position. The focus is NOT to train students to produce accounting information. Rather, the focus is to train students to interpret, evaluate, and use accounting information. Specific topics include revenue recognition, recording expenses, statement of cash flows, inventory, long-term assets, income taxes, liabilities and leases, employee compensation, and intercorporate investments.",
        "After completing the course, students should be able to:",

        "The following textbooks are recommended and may be purchased from Barnes & Noble College:",
        "***For pricing and ordering information, please see the Barnes & Noble College website. Materials will be available at Barnes & Noble College approximately three weeks before the course begins. It is very important that you purchase the correct materials. If your course requires one or more textbooks, you must have exactly the correct text required (edition and year).",
        "Proctored Exams – None.",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 96-100, A- = 90-95, B+ = 87-89, B = 84-86, B- = 80-83, C+ = 77-79, C = 70-76, D = 60-69, F = Below 60",
        "Class participation involves actively taking part in class discussions of current events, course material, analysis of business situations, and classroom exercises. Class Participation Exercises includes the following exercises:",
        "Online participation is required by contributing to the Accounting and Finance Discussion Forum. The instructor will post a question prompt to the discussion forum each week to get the discussion started, but will have minimal participation in the discussions, other than monitoring the discussions throughout the duration of the course.",
        "During the semester, each student must post at least one original post (five points) related to an accounting or finance event. The topic should be related to financial reporting, one course topic, or corporate finance (corporate governance, insider trading, ethics, etc). A qualified original post should be independent from the posts already in the forum, start with an accounting or corporate finance event identified in the financial press, proceed with your summary, and end with a thought-provoking question. No more than five points are earned by original posts. The original post should begin with a headline: Original Post:……",
        "Students are also required to post at least three valid replies (one point each, three points at most) in total in this forum by the end of the semester to get the participation credit. A valid reply contributes positively and meaningfully to the discussion of the current topic. No more than three points are earned as replies.",
        "An example of a valid reply is your own thought supported by data and/or facts. An example of an invalid reply is a simple “Yeah.”, “LOL.”, or “I agree.”",
        "There are assignment problems for each lesson that will be completed on an individual basis. These problems come from the problems of each chapter in the textbook and will correspond to the required readings for each lesson. These problems will not be graded. However, it will be beneficial for you to complete these as they will prepare you for quizzes and course projects.",
        "There will be a short, graded quiz for you to complete after each of the lessons, which will cover the content of lessons, assigned textbook readings, and associated problem assignments.",
        "To facilitate the understanding of the statement of cash flows, students will answer a series of questions based on Wal-Mart’s statement of cash flows for the latest fiscal year.",
        "To facilitate the understanding of assessing earnings quality, students will use the techniques discussed in the textbook and online course content to assess Wal-Mart’s earnings quality.",
        "There is one team-based project that is due at the end of the course (please check the course schedule for the due date). Although the project is not due until the end of the course, it would be beneficial for your team to begin working on the project as early as possible during the course. You are strongly encouraged to form a team of four to six. The purpose of this project is to help you gain further understanding of the knowledge learned in this course by analyzing real-world data and making investment decisions.",
        "After your team has completed the Final Project Assignment, one member of your team should submit your team’s presentation (Word and PowerPoint files) to the drop box by the due date listed in the course syllabus. Please use the following naming convention when submitting your team files to the drop box and include your team name in the subject of the message (e.g., ACCTG512_FinalProject_Team1).",
        "Additionally, your team will need to complete a 20-25 minute video recording of your entire presentation and upload it to Bongo. Your team will need to determine each team member’s role for the presentation. Each team member will then complete their video recording of their assigned section using Bongo. Once the video is completed, you will then need to upload your PowerPoint slides and sync them with your video recording. Note: Each team member will be able to see each member’s presentation and accompanying slides for each section of the presentation. Once all group members’ videos and slides have been uploaded, any of the group members can designate the order of the videos. Note: You will have an opportunity to access the ACCTG 512 class space at Bongo and complete a practice assignment during the first week of the course (this activity will be completed individually).",
        "Since you will be working in a team for this assignment, the instructor will assume that everyone contributes equally and assign the same score to each team member, unless written complaints are received that the teamwork has been unfairly distributed. In this event, the team has to submit a group evaluation sheet indicating each member’s contribution. This evaluation should assign a percentage of the project score that each team member deserves. Although, teams have the responsibility of resolving any conflict that may arise. In the event conflict cannot be resolved, the team can fire the non-contributing member. To be fair to the fired team member, he/she (and the instructor) need to be notified at least a week before the project’s due date. The fired team member will then have to complete the project individually.",

        "Now we’ll talk about some issues with expense recognition.",
        "The first one is bad debt expense. Bad debt expense can significantly impact the amount of net income, which is used to achieve value from performance. The accounting rule is that at the time of sales, sellers have to estimate the uncollectible amount on the basis of the historical experience or industry norms. The amount is recorded as bad debt expense offsetting recorded sales and allowance for doubtful accounts offsetting the recorded amount of accounts receivable in the balance sheet.",
        "The second special case is warranties. The accounting rule states that at the time of the sales, sellers are required to estimate the amount of future original manufacturers’ warranty expense. The recorded warranty expense would depress recorded sales. There is also a need to record future warranty liability simultaneously. This accounting recognition of future expense and future liability as current items at the times of sales will depress net income and increase the amount of liability in the balance sheet at the same time.",
        "Managers have substantial control of the amount of estimated bad debts and estimated warranty expense.",
        "In this lesson we will devote our discussion to analyzing inventories. First, let’s go over the multiple-step income statement. Companies report products being held prior to sale as inventory, which is a current asset on the balance sheet. When the products are sold, the cost of the inventory becomes cost of goods sold in the income statement. The cost of goods sold is then subtracted from net sales to reach gross profit, the first metric of profitability. Additional expenses are subtracted subsequently to calculate net income. The valuation of inventories impacts the calculation of gross profit directly.",
        "Manufacturers must account for three types of inventories:",
        "They can either report the total value of the inventories in the balance sheet and disclose in the footnotes the separate carrying values of those three types of inventories or, they can report those items directly in the balance sheet.",
        "Retailers have only one type of inventory. Figure 8.1. illustrates how a retailer reports cost of goods sold and net income.",
        "A bond contract is also known as a bond indenture. Bond issuers collect cash from investors when the amount of capital needed is too large for one lender to supply. The paybacks of bonds include two streams of future cash flows:",
        "Bonds (by default, we refer to commercial bonds, or bonds issued by public firms) typically carry a $1,000 face value with semiannual interest payments. Note that the quoted interest rates are normally annual rates. So, if you want to calculate the interest amount, you must divide it by two to get the semiannual interest amount",
        "Now one of the reasons firms issue bonds is that the amount of needed capital is too large for any one lender to supply. Some industries, such as telecommunications or manufacturing, are very capital intensive. Firms in those industries need a lot of cash to fund investment projects, to acquire fixed assets, etc. So, their capital needs normally are huge, and they typically go to capital markets and issue bonds to raise capital.",

        "By completing this lesson, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of accounting for employee compensation, equipping you to evaluate the financial impact of these items on organizational performance confidently.",

        "A real-world example of financial accounting challenges occurred when a multinational retail company faced issues with its inventory valuation method. The company had been using the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method for its U.S. operations, while its international divisions employed the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method to comply with local regulations. This inconsistency created challenges in consolidating financial statements and confused investors, as the cost of goods sold (COGS) and ending inventory values varied significantly between regions.",
        "The problem was compounded during a period of inflation when the LIFO method in the U.S. resulted in lower reported earnings compared to the FIFO method used abroad. This discrepancy led to misunderstandings about the company’s profitability and financial health, causing a temporary decline in investor confidence.",
        "To address this issue, the company engaged financial accountants and analysts to assess the impact of switching to a uniform inventory valuation method across all divisions. After conducting a thorough analysis, including evaluating tax implications and regulatory compliance, the company transitioned to the weighted average method globally. This change improved financial statement consistency, enhanced transparency for investors, and facilitated better decision-making at the executive level.",
        "This example highlights the critical importance of understanding inventory valuation methods, their financial statement impact, and the role of financial accounting professionals in resolving complex reporting challenges.",
