        "BUSAD 828: Mergers and Acquisitions is a three-credit course provides a comprehensive exploration of the key drivers of success in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), focusing on both the design and evaluation of these complex transactions. The course blends theoretical insights with practical skills, combining M&A fundamentals, investment banking product training for associates, and real-world case studies.",
        "Students will focus on the type of mergers most relevant to their future careers—acquisitions involving mid-sized private companies or mid-cap public firms. While the emphasis is on practical, applicable transactions, the course leverages larger public-to-public case studies where data is more readily available. These examples illustrate core principles that apply across a variety of deal structures, offering students a broad perspective on M&A strategy and execution.",
        "Through readings, case analyses, and hands-on activities, participants will gain insight into transaction design, valuation techniques, deal structuring, and the strategic rationale behind acquisitions. Upon completing this course, students will be well-prepared to contribute to M&A initiatives, evaluate opportunities with confidence, and navigate the dynamic landscape of corporate acquisitions.",
        "M&A combines a range of disciplines—finance, accounting, corporate strategy, and marketing—that translate an idea into a concrete transaction. We will survey a number of analytic tools and then use those tools to develop your own pitch book exercise.",

        "There are a total of 14 lessons; each lesson will include:",
        "As the course material is very complex and quantitative, your study effort should be devoted to learning the lesson material thoroughly, going over the examples step by step, and solving the problems assigned. The solutions are provided for you to consult and correct any mistakes. You should not look at the solutions first without attempting to solve the problems on your own.",
        "A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment. Students are encouraged to seek the instructor’s input during the process of completing each course requirement. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments.",
        "*Student work will be graded according to the following grading scheme:",
        "A = 94-100, A- = 90-93.9, B+ = 87-89.9, B = 84-86.9, B- = 80-83.9, C+ = 77-79.9, C = 70-76.9, D = 60-69.9, F = Below 60",
        "There will be a final exam to be completed online as individual work.",
        "The final exam will include content that was covered throughout the course. There will be multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. Please be direct and succinct in your answers, limiting the short-answer questions to the number of answers required, and two to three sentences where appropriate.

        "You will be asked to participate in two online discussions (one graded discussion and one ungraded discussion). Please refer to the course schedule to view the due dates for each of the discussion forums. You will also be asked to participate in ongoing online activities and discussions. The following criteria will be used to evaluate student participation:",
        "*subject to change",
        "Rather than adopt a “we will know it when we see it” approach, companies should apply a set of predetermined criteria to potential acquisition targets (however these targets are developed). A range of both financial and strategic criteria will filter out inappropriate acquisitions and minimize wasted efforts while focusing management attention and resources on opportunities that make sense.",
        "Evaluations can include both financial and business considerations. Let’s examine each of these now.",
        "These criteria should be ranked in terms of importance and weighted relative to one another. For a distribution business, the location of facilities, rather than management capability, may be most important, especially if there are plans to reduce management ranks at the target company post-transaction. Developing a useful set of criteria with some relative ranking and weighting is a useful first step in analyzing whether or not an acquisition is a favorable strategic fit.",
        "There are a wide range of major causes of M&A failure. Discussions with acquirers post-transaction, evaluations by academics and consultants studying M&A, and my own experiences reveal a long list of sources of deal failure. Interestingly, many mistakes are made or opportunities for identifying risk are missed in the due diligence phase of a transaction. Overvaluing of synergies, overlooking major target problems, and having difficulty integrating are symptomatic of due diligence failures. Table 5.1 identifies the major sources of deal failure in relation to each stage of a transaction.",
        "What is proper due diligence, and how can it be executed? The key focus needs to be on those issues that have the greatest effect on the ultimate success of the acquired company. The following six factors matter in an acquisition:",
        "Due diligence needs to be based on validating and verifying assumptions and beliefs associated with these factors while identifying risks that threaten the ultimate success of the transaction.",
        "At its most critical, due diligence focuses on answering these questions:",
        "We will focus on EV/revenue, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, and P/E. Keep in mind that certain industries utilize different metrics; we will review some specific examples at the end of lesson.",
        "Acquisition multiples reflect the control premium typically required in change-of-control transactions. Acquisition multiples may or may not reflect the potential synergies that the acquirer hopes to realize post-close. The level to which a transaction would include potential synergies is dependent on the level of competition for the target acquisition. The greater the competition and the more aggressive the bidding, the more potential synergies to be shared with the target’s shareholders.",
        "The bottom line is that precedent transaction analyses are similar to comparable public companies analyses, but with a different perspective. While precedent transaction analyses also focus on comparing a relative valuation metric to a target acquisition, the basis for comparison is actual purchases rather than public market multiples.",
        "One main thesis of this type of analysis is that similar companies are purchased based on similar multiples; these multiples can be applied to a privately held or publicly traded company in order to imply a comparable value.",
        "As a valuation tool, precedent transactions supplement other valuation methodologies to answer the following kinds of questions:",
        "Transaction valuation analysis is not a science; valuing a company is difficult and can be a subjective process. Since no two companies or transactions are identical, we must value a company relative to other transactions, taking into account differences in business, size, profitability, potential synergies, and growth prospects, as well as intangible differences, such as reputation and brand equity. Historical valuation relies on information that may not reflect undisclosed company-specific opportunities/capabilities. Since acquisition multiples are historical valuations, present circumstances should also be considered (e.g., a growing versus a mature industry, the interest rate environment, government regulations, etc.).",

This skill set positions graduates to lead deal-making processes and drive organizational growth.",
        "One real-world example of a mergers and acquisitions project can be seen in the technology industry. A large software company sought to acquire a mid-sized cybersecurity firm to expand its service offerings and improve its competitive edge in data protection solutions. While the strategic rationale for the deal was sound, the company faced challenges during valuation and integration planning. The target company’s financials included inconsistent revenue streams and complex contracts, which made determining an accurate valuation difficult. Additionally, the cultural and operational differences between the two firms posed risks to the post-acquisition integration process.",
        "To address these challenges, the acquiring company conducted thorough due diligence to analyze the target’s contracts, intellectual property, and financial projections. A team of analysts applied Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and comparable transaction methodologies to derive a fair valuation for the target firm. Additionally, a cross-functional integration team was assembled to align operations, address cultural gaps, and ensure a seamless transition. This effort led to a successful acquisition that strengthened the acquirer’s cybersecurity capabilities, drove revenue growth, and positioned the company as a market leader in data protection. This project highlights the importance of robust valuation techniques, diligent risk assessment, and careful integration planning in the success of M&A transactions.",
