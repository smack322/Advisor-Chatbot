        "Decision trees are non-linear predictors. It means that decision boundary between target variable classes is non-linear. The extent of non-linearities depends on the number of splits in the tree as each split is a piecewise constant separator as shown in figure 2. As the tree becomes more complex, the depth increases, and more piecewise constant separators are built into the decision boundary providing the non-linear separation.",

        "One real-world example of applying concepts from AI801: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence can be seen in the transportation industry. A major city aimed to implement an AI-driven traffic management system to reduce congestion, improve road safety, and lower emissions. However, initial attempts were unsuccessful due to a lack of understanding of AI principles and poor integration of data sources. The system struggled to process the vast amounts of traffic data in real-time, and the predictive models it used were inaccurate, leading to mismanagement of traffic signals and ineffective rerouting suggestions. This resulted in increased traffic delays, frustration among commuters, and wasted resources.",
        "To address this issue, a team with expertise in AI principles—similar to those taught in AI801—was brought in. Using foundational knowledge of reinforcement learning and probabilistic reasoning, they developed an intelligent traffic system that dynamically adjusted signals based on real-time traffic data and predicted congestion patterns. They incorporated robust machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and live traffic data, ensuring accurate predictions and timely responses. As a result, the new system significantly reduced congestion, improved traffic flow, and enhanced commuter satisfaction. This example highlights the real-world impact of applying AI foundations to design effective and intelligent systems for complex problems.",
