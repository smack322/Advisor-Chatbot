        "*subject to change",
        "During the ideation and prototyping phases product concepts are tested to identify features and versions that are likely to be successful in the marketplace. Concept tests typically involve asking consumers survey questions about their perceptions of the offering and its characteristics–including assessing aspects such as usefulness, liking, and purchase intent.",
        "Conjoint analysis is a research tool that is often employed for this purpose. It relies on a research methodology using survey questions to identify combinations of product/service elements leading to the greatest market receptivity. Respondents are presented with a variety of product packages, each with different versions of features, and are asked to select those they’re most interested in. Back-end analytics then identify the features that produce the strongest positive responses, thereby helping marketers to identify the right combination of product characteristics",
        "The goal of marketing is to move customers through the purchase journey and beyond to loyalty. The customer lifecycle framework postulates that this process has six phases. It begins when customers discover the brand and its offerings and is ongoing as brands maintain relationships with customers via engagement that keeps them coming back. Let’s talk about each phase specifically, and review some analytics you may apply to generate insights for each area.",
        "Kano analysis (named after the individual who created the model) is a technique for identifying the features of an offering that are likely to be most successfully received by customers. The model identifies the most relevant and important features of an offering by how well they perform on 2 dimensions.",
        "The Kano model assumes that customers have three types of needs. There are varying terminologies associated with these 3 groups so if you see different verbiage be aware they’re all getting at the same concepts:",
        "These are features that customers expect from a product (sometimes called ‘cost of entry’ because they are essentially required by an offering in their market). For example, texting ability is a feature the majority (if not all) customers expect from a cell phone; therefore, a cell phone producer must include that feature to meet this expected need. In Kano analysis, these needs are sometimes referred to as ‘must be’ because without them customers would not consider the offering. These features don’t create excitement or delight but can lead to customer dissatisfaction if not done well.",
        "These features are the next step up from expected needs–the ones that customers want from an offering. They’re also the features of an offering that differentiate it in the marketplace. To continue with my example, texting functionality is an expected feature for a cell phone but a high-megapixel camera is likely to be a differentiating feature for a cell phone. In Kano analysis, these types of features are called ‘satisfiers’ because when done well they increase customer satisfaction.",
        "These are features of an offering that set it far apart from competitors. These features meet needs customers may not even know they have, and when included they elicit feelings of delight (which is why Kano analysis often refers to them as ‘delighters’). Customers don’t expect these features, but when they are included they can greatly increase satisfaction. For example, an AI technology feature in a cell phone may meet this criterion.",
