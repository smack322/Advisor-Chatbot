        "Two exams will be given. You will have up to 5 days to complete each exam. You are expected to work alone on the exams, and are free to use whatever material that you have at your disposal. Late exams will not be accepted unless there are mitigating circumstances.  Exams are worth 50% of your grade.",
        "*subject to change",
        "As part of data exploration, we frequently use graphs to visualize data to better understand and interpret the data on hand. In lesson 2, we tried some basic graphs in R. We will learn and exercise much more techniques employed in R, including imported libraries supports.",
        "Let’s start with the simplest plot function, plot(x,y) can draw a scatter plot, where x-axis represents x value in order and y-axis represents y values. We continue to use the dataset from a telecommunication organization. After loading the Customers.xlsx, for example, plot(Customers$Age, Customers$Est_Income) will create the following scatterplot (Fig. 3.1.1).",
        "The Regression Model is a statistical methodology that studies the relationships between different variables so that we can predict one variable from other variables. In linear regression, the output variable (also termed as dependent variable, outcome, or response) is predicted by a linearly weighted combination of input variables (also termed as independent variables, features, or predictors). Here is an example of a simple linear model:",
        "yˆ=β1x+β0y^=β1x+β0",
        "ŷ is the estimated output, which is calculated from a linear function of a single predictor variable or feature x. β are the parameters of the model and are usually termed as regression coefficients. The number of β changes with the number of features of a model. We always have an extra coefficient termed as intercept β0, which is the value when all features are valued at zero. The other β coefficients can be interpreted as the expected change in ŷ due to per unit increase of a corresponding feature.",
        "The linear regression model tries to find the best β to minimize sum of square error.",
        "Tree-based Methods",
        "As one of supervised learning algorithms, tree-based methods are mostly used in classification problems. By relying on greedy strategies, tree-based methods essentially consist of a series of rules that can be generated using a tree structure (Fig. 7.1.1 and Fig. 7.1.2). Tree-based methods are easily used for predictions applicable for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In general, if the output variable is categorical, we use a decision tree to handle classification problems (Fig. 7.1.1). If the output variable is continuous or numerical, we then use it to tackle regression problems (Fig. 7.1.2).",

        "A retail chain faced a significant challenge in managing its inventory and optimizing stock levels across its stores. Products were either overstocked, leading to high storage costs and wasted goods, or understocked, resulting in missed sales and dissatisfied customers. The company lacked a clear understanding of customer purchasing patterns and was unable to predict demand effectively. This inefficiency led to revenue losses and reduced customer satisfaction, highlighting the critical need for a predictive analytics solution.",
