        "Three Types of Data Models",
        "In this page, you will see examples for the three types of data model. Hierarchical data model looks like this:",
        "Network data model looks like this:",
        "The main difference between hierarchical data model and network data model is that for hierarchical data model, a child can have only one parent, wile for network data model, a child can have more than one parents. For example, C2 has two parents, B1 and B2.",
        "Figure 4.1 in your textbook is the example for relational data model. Compared to hierarchical data model and network data model, relational data model is more flexible in the sense that you can add tables and relationships anytime, whether it is during the model building process or after the process. This also means that you do not have to build all the relationships at the time of model creation. In this course, you will learn how to build relational database.",
        "Types of Joins",
        "A join specifies how to combine records from two or more tables in a database. There are two basic types of joins: The inner join and the outer join. Inner Join will display only the rows or records where the joined fields from both tables are equal. If we use a circle to represent a table, inner join will result in the records of the shaded areas in the picture below. Inner join is the default join type in Microsoft Access.",
        "An outer join displays all rows from one table and only those rows or records from the other table where the joined fields are equal. The shaded area in the picture below represents the results from the outer join.",
        "There are two types of outer joins. The picture above is the demonstration of left outer join, which will include all the rows from the first (left) table. The picture below is the demonstration of right outer join, which will include all the rows from the second (right) table.",
        "Structured Query Language (SQL)",
        "In the next three Access projects, you will use SQL to answer some questions regarding database. The first two projects are group projects and the last one is an individual project. In this way, you can first learn from your peers if you have anything not understanding from the textbook. Here, I will provide some basic format of SQL you will use in the projects. The basic format is as follows (words with all capital letters in bold indicating SQL operators/clauses etc.):",
        "A developer named Laszlo Hanyecz in Jacksonville, FL posted a message on May 18, 2010 as follows:",
        "“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas..like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.

Lines connecting these neurons symbolize the neural connections, indicating the flow of information through the network. The structure aims to illustrate how an image input (man holding dog) can be processed through a neural network.",
