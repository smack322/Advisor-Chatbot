You won’t be able to see peer responses until you post your responses to these questions. Your participation in the mandatory discussion forums will be graded as STRICT credit/no credit grading policy. That is, your responses will be graded for participation, not for accuracy. However, you are supposed to make an honest attempt to explain your approach to each problem I post. Simple “YES, NO, I agree” responses, or responses that show poor effort would not be sufficient, and will result in a zero grade. Mandatory discussion forums are usually due on Saturdays (you will find the exact deadlines in the Course schedule). I will summarize your thoughts and post my feedback as a single response in an announcement to the entire class after the due date.",

        "An interval of values computed from sample data that is likely to cover the true parameter of interest.",
        "There are many estimators for population parameters. For example, if we want to know the “center” of a distribution, why use the mean? Could we use the median? How about using the middle value, i.e. (max+min)/2? We choose particular estimators for various reasons with information based on their sampling distributions. Here are some properties of “good” estimators.",
        "The primary method for displaying the summarization of categorical variables is called a contingency table. When we have two measurements on our subjects that are both categorical, the contingency table is sometimes referred to as a two-way table.",
        "This terminology is derived because the summarized table consists of rows and columns (i.e., the data display goes two ways).",
        "The size of a contingency table is defined by the number of rows times the number of columns associated with the levels of the two categorical variables. The size is notated r×c, where r is the number of rows of the table and c is the number of columns. A cell displays the count for the intersection of a row and column. Thus the size of a contingency table also gives the number of cells for that table. For example, if we have a 2×2 table, then we have 2(2)=4 cells.",
        "As we will see, these contingency tables usually include a ‘total’ row and a ‘total’ column which represent the marginal totals, i.e., the total count in each row and the total count in each column. This total row and total column are NOT included in the size of the table. The size refers to the number of levels to the actual categorical variables in the study.",
