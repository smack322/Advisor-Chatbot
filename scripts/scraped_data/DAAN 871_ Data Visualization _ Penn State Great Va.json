        "DAAN 871 is a three-credit course that introduces the principles, concepts, and tools of data visualization, with a focus on transforming complex, abstract datasets into visual formats that are easy to interpret and analyze. This course emphasizes the importance of visualization strategies in understanding large data sets, uncovering patterns, and supporting decision-making processes across various domains. Unlike scientific visualization, which deals with spatial or physical data representations, this course centers on how to map complex data into understandable visual forms.",
        "Students will explore several key techniques for visualizing different types of data, such as one-dimensional (e.g., temporal data), two-dimensional (e.g., geospatial data), and multidimensional data (e.g., relational data in n-dimensional space). They will also learn methods for visualizing hierarchical data (e.g., tree structures), networks (e.g., social networks), and more. The course also emphasizes the identification of patterns, trends, and insights from visualizations in diverse fields like business, science, engineering, and social media. Additionally, students will gain practical experience using popular data visualization tools such as Tableau and Gephi, providing them with hands-on skills to apply in real-world data analysis projects.",
        "In this course, students will learn the key principles involved in data visualization and will explore a wide range of visualization approaches that can be applied to understanding complex data across different data types. Specifically, techniques for visualizing:",
        "Emphasis will be placed on the identification of patterns, trends, and differences in visualizations of data from a variety of domains (e.g., science, business, engineering, computer vision (CV), etc.). In addition, students will gain hands-on experience with a variety of visualization tools including Qlik and Python.",
        "The objective of this course is to introduce students to the principles of data visualization and to provide them with hands-on experience with different tools and techniques for visualizing large complex data sets.

        "In the emerging age of big data, it is not uncommon for the terms data visualization, scientific visualization, information visualization and infographics to be used interchangeably. While there are no hard and fast rules that delineate the classification of these visualization types, let’s examine how data scientists generally view the relationship between these visualization categories.",
        "First, data visualization is generally used as an umbrella term under which other visualization categories fall. As Stephen Few (2009) summarizes:",
        "“I use data visualization as an umbrella term to cover all types of visual representations that support the exploration, examination, and communication of data.‘Whatever the representation, as long as it’s visual, and whatever it represents, as long as it’s information, this constitutes data visualization”.",
        "Next, let’s consider some key sub-categories that fall under the data visualization domain including information visualization and scientific visualizations.",
        "Stuart Card (1999) defines visualization and the sub-categories of scientific visualization vs. information visualization as follows:",
        "Data Visualization: “The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognitition.” ( p. 6)",
        "(Click the tabs to learn more)",
        "Scientific visualizations focus on visualizing measurable scientific data or complex simulated data that can be mapped to coordinate system (e.g., statistical graphs and charts). This includes scientific data mapped onto spatial coordinates associated with real-world objects that can be used to help explain observed scientific phenomenon. Examples of such domain specific visualizations include medical imaging, business intelligence, or geographic information systems. (See Figure 1.2)",
        "Information visualization corresponds to the visualization of more abstract data that may lack inherent spatial components. Such abstract data is ultimately processed into a more tangible form that can be readily understood by others. Examples include network analysis where relationship data is mapped to a network form so patterns and relationships in complex datasets can be readily identified. Examples include social networks, metabolic networks and internet communication. (See Figure 1.3)",
        "In visualizing a whole, we are interested in seeing how its individual parts compare relative to each other. Since a whole represents 100% of something, all its individual parts must add up to 100%. The simplest way to visualize a whole and its parts is through a pie chart. Figure 6.2 shows a breakdown of orders that are shipped at a company (Superstore).",
        "“How Do We Ship Our Orders?” is the question we are trying to explore here. Each wedge on the pie chart (see Figure 6.2) is labeled to indicate the type and percentage of the shipping mode. The circle represents the whole and is proportionately carved out into wedges that represent its part. Since a complete turn about a circle is 360 degrees, the percentage value of each wedge is calculated as a ratio of its angle to 360 degrees. For example, a 90-degrees wedge would represent 90/360 or 25% of the whole. All wedges add up to 360 degrees or 100%. Often times pie charts have been criticized since people have trouble judging proportions from angles of wedges. However, a simple pie chart properly labeled and not overcrowded with wedges can be quite useful.",
        "Here the output obtained from the script provided in Table 13.2 is omitted. Students are encouraged to execute the scripts in Table 13.2 and interpret the output. Let us now visualize the selected 3D image. Here it is important to remember that many image viewers, such as matplotlib’s imshow, are only capable of displaying 2D data. To visualize the 3D image, we will fix one axis and still use the imshow function to display the grayscale 2D images using different views (see Figure 13.1). The script for viewing the different views of the 3D image is provided in Table 13.3.",
        "As discussed above, a 3D image can be viewed as a series of 2D planes (image). Table 13.4 provides a helper function, display, to create a montage of several planes. By default, every other plane is displayed (see Figure 13.2).",
