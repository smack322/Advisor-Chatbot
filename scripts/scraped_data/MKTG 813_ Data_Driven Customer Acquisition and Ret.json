        "Welcome to MKTG 813: Data-Driven Customer Acquisition and Retention. This cutting-edge course empowers you to harness data-driven strategies to transform customer relationships into valuable, long-term assets for any organization. By integrating customer management with marketing strategy, you’ll learn to view customers as pivotal assets and leverage data to enhance loyalty, satisfaction, and overall value. Focusing on firms operating in data-rich environments, MKTG 813 also explores traditional strategies to provide a well-rounded perspective on customer relationship management. Key themes include targeted approaches for managing high-value customers and strategies to optimize the lifecycle of customer relationships.",
        "Central to the course is the customer lifecycle framework, which provides actionable insights into acquiring, developing, and retaining customers while addressing challenges such as attrition and win-back. You’ll dive into essential topics like customer loyalty programs, customer economics (profitability, lifetime value, and equity), and advanced marketing analytics. Gain hands-on experience with powerful tools such as decile analysis, RFM analysis, choice models (e.g., logit, probit), and data mining techniques like classification and decision trees. This course equips you with the knowledge and skills to make data-driven decisions and drive measurable success in customer management.",
        "This course focuses on marketing strategy as it relates to customer management, where the philosophy is to view customers as assets of the firm and the goal is to use customer information to build customer loyalty and relationships. This involves, in part, applying differential attention to more valuable customers with the goal of improving customer satisfaction while optimizing the current and future value of the customer base. The course will focus primarily on firms in ‘data-rich’ environments – that is, firms with detailed data on individual customers and firms with many customers. However, we will also spend time discussing more traditional customer relationship strategies and tactics.",
        "The course is built around a single customer framework: the customer lifecycle. This general framework emphasizes strategic initiatives in customer relationship management including identifying good prospects and customer acquisition; customer development through up-selling, cross-selling and personalization; customer attrition and retention; and win-back. Topics covered include customer loyalty and loyalty programs, customer economics including customer profitability, lifetime value, and customer equity.",
        "The course will also provide an introduction – including the advantages, limitations, common uses and some best practice examples – of commonly used marketing analytic tools and techniques. These include decile analysis, RFM (recency/frequency/monetary) analysis, choice models (e.g. logit, probit, etc.), and data mining tools (e.g. classification and decision trees such as CHAID).",
