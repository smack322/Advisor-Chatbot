        "SYSEN 850: Creativity & Problem Solving is a three-credit course that offers students an essential grounding in the art and science of problem solving within Engineering Management. Emphasizing creativity, cognitive processes, and problem-solving techniques, this course empowers students to navigate complex challenges with innovation and strategic clarity. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, students explore how creativity and structure can work together to drive effective solutions. Topics include cognitive function, styles of problem solving, and the nuanced role of structure, all of which lay a critical foundation for advanced courses like SYSEN 552.",
        "In addition to theory, SYSEN 850 incorporates hands-on activities and case studies across engineering, science, and management fields, ensuring students can apply their learning in real-world settings. By analyzing change as a catalyst and learning to manage diverse problem-solving approaches within teams, students will leave the course with a refined toolkit of adaptive strategies and collaborative skills. This course is ideal for students looking to build versatile, interdisciplinary skills in problem solving, making them well-prepared to lead and innovate in the complex landscape of Engineering Management.",
        "This course provides students with the socio-technical foundations needed to address the interdisciplinary, integrative, and collaborative aspects of Engineering Management; this foundation will be developed further in SYSEN 552. This course will address fundamental principles of individual problem solving, creativity, and the process of change, establishing a solid and rigorous core of facilitating concepts and language that will be useful throughout the program. To serve this purpose, selected elements of cognitive psychology will be examined, along with general and domain-specific models of problem solving and change processes, a range of problem solving techniques, and illustrative examples of these (and other) key topics in a variety of contexts.",
        "Specific coverage will include:",
        "Students entering this class are assumed to have no previous expertise in cognitive psychology or any other related social science. The course is designed to provide a basic yet thorough introduction to problem solving from the individual perspective, including the diverse ways in which people respond to and seek to bring about change. It serves as the prerequisite for SYSEN 552: Creativity and Problem Solving II, where principles of collaborative problem solving will be examined.",
        "The fundamental objective of this course is to help students become better and more effective problem solvers through a clear understanding of the cognitive processes involved in individual problem solving and creative activity. Students who complete this course successfully will be able to:",

        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95 – 100, A- = 90 – 94, B+ = 87 – 89, B = 84 – 86, B- = 80 – 83, C+ = 77 – 79, C = 70 – 76, D = 60 – 69, and F = 60 and below.",
        "There will be a discussion forum associated with each lesson. You are required to log on to every discussion forum and to post at least one original response related to the assigned topic as well as a minimum of two substantive responses (in general) to your classmates postings. The specific posting requirements will be included along with the discussion topic for each forum. You are not required to follow threads from previous lessons, but you are always welcome to post comments that relate to any previous discussion if it also relates to the current theme in some way.",
        "Your instructor will monitor all discussion forums and will participate in them throughout the course to evaluate your performance every week and provide feedback (as a group and/or on an individual basis). Your formal grade for discussion forum performance will be calculated based on the number of postings you make and the quality of your comments (e.g., degree of advanced thinking, quality of communication).",
        "There will be two written assignments during the course: Reflection & Synthesis (R&S) #1 – #2. These are due at the end of Lessons 2 and 5, respectively. The purpose of these assignments is to help you reflect upon, analyze, synthesize, and apply the material covered in this course. You are welcome to work together in the early stages of these assignments (e.g., discussing your ideas, pondering approaches, recommending references), but the final product must be entirely your own individual work.",
        "In completing each assignment, you are expected to submit neat, organized, and complete written documents that demonstrate higher order thinking and good communication skills (i.e., the quality of your writing will be assessed). Typed assignments (1.5 line spacing or double-spaced; 12-point font; 1″ margins; and citations following either the APA or MLA format) are required. Each written assignment is worth a total of 100 points and 20% of your course grade. Of these 100 points, 80 points will be used to assess the content of your response (e.g., have you completed the required task, the depth of your analysis), while the remaining 20 points will be used to assess the quality of your communication (e.g., your writing – grammar, spelling, punctuation, clarity of expression, etc.).",
        "There will be two exams: one midterm exam (20% of course grade) and one final exam (20% of course grade). The purpose of these exams is to ensure your ready recall of fundamental concepts and key points covered in this course; they will not focus on minute detail (e.g., no dates). In terms of format, all exams will be primarily (if not completely) multiple choice, with the possibility of a few short answer questions.",
        "All exams will be given as timed online exams, offered within prescribed windows of opportunity during the appropriate week. You will have a restricted amount of time to complete each exam once you have begun it – i.e., you will not be able to “pause” or “save” the exam and return to it later. All exams are to be completed without the collaboration or assistance of any other individuals, including other students, and without access to previous copies of any exam from this course. You will be “on your honor” to follow these requirements; evidence of cheating will be dealt with according to Penn State Academic Integrity policies.",
        "Both exams will be proctored online using proctoring software that uses your computer’s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record your activity during exams. The proctoring software may be listening to you, monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, and recording any activity (including visual and audio recordings) during the proctoring process.",
        "*subject to change",
        "Here, we are dealing fundamentally with reason, as opposed to reflex or instinct as mentioned above. This schema is not a physiological diagram; instead, it shows the brain’s functioning as departments of an organization whose primary aim is self-survival (imagine a boardroom of 100 billion neurons, looking after 100 trillion other cells!).",
        "Note the three main elements of cognition:",
        "as well as these other important terms: Behavior, Environment, and Product. Now we will consider the basic functions, roles, and relationships of and between all of the above.",
        "First, Cognitive Affect selects the problem (opportunity) to solve out of all those available (however they have come to our attention) and determines the kind of solution needed or desired, includ­ing the means that are acceptable for attaining it. So, for example, you might be asked to produce a particular circuit assembly in half the usual time, but without sacrificing quality. Or, you might have to defend yourself against an attacker, but choose to disarm the person rather than kill him. These choices are driven by motive, another of the four principal elements of problem solving.",
        "Note the subtext in this portion of the schema – i.e., I WANT – which describes motive in its most general form. Freud (an Austrian who founded psychoanalysis) separated “I WANT” into three specific parts: I NEED – I LIKE – I OUGHT. I NEED is the imperative – I must find the solution or die. I LIKE comes into play when I have options and can choose the solution I prefer (assuming it is available). I OUGHT operates when I am willing to postpone an immediate reward for a later, “higher” reward (e.g., for the sake of others, the team); I OUGHT helps us collaborate with those (needed) others and provides a reason for the development of ethics. All these forms of motive will be reflected in what I KNOW (Cognitive Resource), since the opportunities (problems) I choose to tackle (based on motive) will determine the knowledge and experience I need to gain (and will pursue).",
        "Once the problem (opportunity) has been chosen via Cognitive Affect, Cognitive Effect carries out the detailed problem solving process, i.e., it plans a problem’s solution through to implementation (I PLAN). This process is enabled and limited by one’s:",
        "More specifically, potential cognitive level (“at what level”) refers to one’s innate capacity for problem solving; it is measured by such means as intelligence, talent, and/or the degree of complexity one can handle. Cognitive style (“in what way”) refers to the preferred and stable manner in which a person responds to and seeks to bring about change (including the solution of problems); style can also be measured along a number of dimensions, including Adaption-Innovation, Introversion-Extraversion, etc.",
        "Level and style are independent, a fact we will simply state now, with proofs provided later (in Lesson 3). We also note that style is established early in life (by one’s mid-teens, if not sooner) and does not change – i.e., style is fixed. So, just as style is independent from capacity (i.e., level), style is also not behavior, which is flexible (through coping behavior – which is learned; see more on Behavior below).",
        "Finally, Cognitive Resource contains and processes the accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience of the individual (I KNOW). This is manifest level (what you actually know about different things – e.g., engineering, playing an instrument, foreign languages, etc.), as opposed to potential level (your capacity to know, which is housed in Cognitive Effect). Here is a simple analogy: potential level describes the size (and shape) of the cognitive “bucket” that is your brain; manifest level describes the contents of that bucket.",
        "Cognitive Resource is your “backroom powerhouse” that influences the scope of all other operations; it continues to digest and manipulate its contents at all times (even as we sleep) – accumulating events, and by learning, turning them into experience, and by further learning, transforming experience into theory (whether one uses this term or not). Brought to bear throughout the problem solving process, it is the accumulation of the results from all previous problem solving activities, as well as feedback from the environment.",
        "Some techniques are intended to release potential capacity, i.e., to help us utilize more of the capacity we were born with or to utilize it more effectively. So, for example, if your idea generation is blocked, you might do something that relaxes you – e.g., take a walk around the block, go driving in your car, take a nap, etc. – i.e., something aimed at reducing the fatigue or anxiety that may be impeding the best use of your capacity (rather like “helping” your computer by restarting it). Or, if you are distracted (say, by too much noise or too many stimuli), you might go find a quiet place to do your work, break things down into small pieces, or do the parts that require the least concentration. These techniques are all examples of things we can do to release additional potential level (from within our existing store); they don’t solve the problem you are working on directly, but they may enable you to do so later or more efficiently.",
        "Recall the processes associated with Cognitive Resource – i.e., Learning and Memory. Techniques to enhance manifest level can be used to impact the effectiveness of either or both of these. So, enhancing manifest level refers to increasing how much we learn (and retain) and how quickly we learn it, as well as how much of it we recall and how quickly/effectively we recall it.",
        "There are many different kinds of techniques aimed at enhancing manifest level. One example is mnemonics, which include acronyms (e.g., “ROY G BIV” for colors of the rainbow – Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet), acrostics (“Every Good Boy Does Fine” for the G-clef notes on sheet music), and rhymes. For many more examples, search the Web using “mnemonic devices” or “mnemonic techniques” as keywords. Another example is the group of methods called “speed reading” techniques; these enable a person to work through more written information in less time, with a higher level of retention. Since techniques aimed at enhancing manifest level improve actual (level) performance, they increase one’s problem solving effectiveness directly.",
        "It is appropriate to consider once again the larger context of problem solving and how the specific material we have been learning fits into this strategic view. To support this exercise, refer to the Table below as we discuss the progression of theoretical elements, fundamental aims, practical entry points, and personal insights that guide our study along the path from the individual problem solver to problem solving teams and, ultimately, to problem solving leadership. In this course, you are completing the first stage of this journey; let’s summarize its key features first and then explore where they will lead.",
