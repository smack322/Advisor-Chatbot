        "The Software Engineering Capstone Experience course, SWENG 894, is the culminating opportunity for students to synthesize their academic and professional learning into a fully developed software solution, known as a minimum viable product (MVP). This course enables students to apply their skills in a real-world context, encouraging exploration of advanced tools, techniques, and programming languages with dedicated guidance from faculty.",
        "In this final project, students can innovate by proposing, designing, and developing a custom software product that tackles a specific problem, addressing all essential phases from requirements gathering to UI prototyping, testing, and deployment. Working solo or in small, instructor-approved teams, students gain hands-on experience with an agile development process incorporating best practices from SCRUM, Kanban, and DevOps, adapted to fit an academic environment. This course not only challenges students to stretch their technical skills but also refines their project management and collaborative abilities, making it a fulfilling and practical experience that prepares them for real-world software engineering challenges.",
        "The purpose of this course is to bring together the knowledge from previous courses and your working experience in the form of a significant software solution that we will refer to as a minimum viable product (MVP). It will allow you the opportunity to try new tools, techniques, and programming languages to build the software solution that you will propose. It is your last chance to try new techniques under faculty guidance in the Software Engineering program, and I want you to stretch a little and try new things. You will work individually or in small teams (upon approval of the instructor) to create an MVP from conception (e.g., software requirements and architecture) through development, UI prototyping, testing, and deployment. The capstone course adopts an agile-like approach that incorporates best practices from SCRUM, Kanban, and DevOps to make it feasible to develop a product in an academic environment. We hope you enjoy the journey.",
        "This course has been designed to give each student the experience of developing a significant software product from requirements to code using a development process, tools, and technologies of their choice.  By the end of the course, you will be able to:",
        "There are no required purchased materials for this course.",
        "Proctored Exams –  None",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",

        "One example of a real-world project suited for a software engineering graduate with capstone experience is in the healthcare sector, where a hospital sought to develop a telemedicine platform for virtual consultations. The initial platform struggled with HIPAA compliance and offered a complex user interface, resulting in low adoption rates by both patients and providers. To address these issues, a software engineer with a capstone background in user-centered design and secure system development was brought in. Through stakeholder consultations, they redefined the platform’s requirements, emphasizing data security and usability. By implementing robust encryption protocols and simplifying the interface, the engineer created a secure, user-friendly platform that met regulatory standards, significantly increased adoption, and ultimately improved access to virtual healthcare services.",
        "Another impactful example is in the financial technology industry, where a bank aimed to deploy a real-time fraud detection tool to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. The initial system failed to process data efficiently, causing delays that allowed some fraudulent transactions to go undetected. A software engineering graduate with capstone experience in machine learning and scalable system architecture was recruited to revamp the tool. They worked closely with data scientists to design a machine learning algorithm capable of processing transactions in real time and identifying suspicious activity patterns. With this enhanced fraud detection system, the bank effectively reduced fraudulent activity, protected client assets, and improved trust, showcasing the value of hands-on capstone experience in designing responsive, data-driven solutions.",
