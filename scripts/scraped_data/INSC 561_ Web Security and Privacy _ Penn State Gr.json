        "A few basic reminders, harking back to your Online Orientation:",
        "*Subject to change",
        "Web-centric or web-based applications are everywhere. We have much richer multimedia applications than ever before, which operate within the browser and mobile apps, rather than separate applications that people have to download to their PC desktops or mobile phones. The browser or the like (e.g., mobile apps)  / server computing model will continue to be one of our mainstream programming models empowering the majority computing solutions.",
        "A web-based application is accessible over a network through the Internet or an intranet. Technically, it refers to a computer software application that is largely coded in a browser-supported language (such as JavaScript, XML, combined with a browser-rendered markup language like HTML).",
        "Web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of web browsers and apps. Unlike a traditional (or proprietary) client/server model, a web-centric model enables the ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on potentially thousands of client computers, which is a key reason for their popularity. More important, from the end user’s perspective, web-centric applications essentially provide computing applications with scalability and flexibility due to the inherited open system architecture, language-independence, and platform-independence.",
        "Due to the increasing growth of web-centric applications, the Internet has consolidated itself as a very powerful platform that has changed the way we do business, communicate, learn, and live. The Internet, as no other communication medium, has given an international (globalized) dimension to the world. The Internet has become the universal source of information for millions of people, at home, at school, and at work. As a result, the traditional barriers of time difference and geographical distance get essentially eliminated.",
        "Common Web Applications",
        "Common web applications include the following:",
        "Like anything else, a web-centric application has pros and cons. Some pros and cons may switch sides under certain circumstances. This would be especially true when computing technologies evolve and security concerns become a daunting factor in organizations.",
        "Select each tab below to read about the benefits and challenges of web-based applications.",
        "Authentication is the front line to shield unauthorized access to a web application that holds confidential information. Legitimate users use a combination of credentials (e.g., username, password, and two-factor code) to log on. There are many different technologies available for developers to implement authentication mechanisms. Below is a list of popular authentication technologies used in web applications [2]:",
        "Web Resources",
        "Please read the linked web pages above to get a better understanding of the technologies. Although some of them may seem outdated, you might still find them adopted by many web sites.",
        "Because of design flaws and weak implementations using the above technologies, some web applications become extremely vulnerable in terms of protecting authentication attacks. For example, only about 14% of passwords used by legitimate users are considered strong. In other words, the majority of legitimate users use weak authentications due to web design flaws, weak implementations, or misuses.",
        "Pie Chart Information on Statistical Report of Passwords",
        "As seen in Figure 4.1, bad passwords are used by many legitimate users. If a web application is designed in such a way that a user can use any password the user likes, it surely has a flaw in its authentication functionality design.",
        "Common weak authentication designs and implementations include the following [1]:",
        "The OWASP SQL injection prevention cheat sheet provides a set of simple techniques for preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The following techniques (extracted from this cheat sheet) can be used with practically any kind of programming language with any type of database.",
        "The following (Java) example would allow an attacker to inject code into the query, resulting in that the delivered query would be straightforwardly executed by the database. Lacking a proper input validation, the “customerName” parameter simply appended to the query allows an attacker to inject any SQL code the attacker wants. Obviously, this simple while commonly used code is extremely unsafe.",
        "(Click the tabs to learn more)",
        "The use of prepared statements (aka parameterized queries) is simple. Parameterized queries are easy to write, and easier to understand when compared to dynamic queries. Essentially, parameterized queries force developers to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter to the query later. As a result, the use of parameterized queries allows a database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied.",
        "The following code example uses a PreparedStatement, Java’s implementation of a parameterized query, to execute the same database query. The above unsafe example becomes safe.",
        "Stored procedures have the same effect as the use of prepared statements. They require developers to define the SQL code first, and then pass in the parameters after. The difference between prepared statements and stored procedures is that the SQL code for a stored procedure is defined and stored in the database itself, and then called from the application.",
        "The following code example uses a CallableStatement, Java’s implementation of the stored procedure interface, to execute the same database query. The “sp_getAccountBalance” stored procedure would have to be predefined in the database and implement the same functionality as the query defined above.",
        "This third technique is to escape user input before putting it in a query. Each database management system (DBMS) supports one or more character escaping schemes specific to certain kinds of queries. If you then escape all user supplied input using the proper escaping scheme for the database you are using, the DBMS will not confuse that input with SQL code written by the developer, thus avoiding any possible SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
        "For instance, every occurrence of a single quote (‘) in a parameter must be replaced by two single quotes (”) to form a valid SQL string literal. In PHP, for example, it is usual to escape parameters using the function mysql_real_escape_string() before sending the SQL query [2]:",

        "In the end, this lesson will equip students with the knowledge and practical skills needed to identify, exploit, and defend against attacks on web servers and server-side applications, providing a comprehensive understanding of server security.",
        "A career in Web Security and Privacy offers tremendous growth potential as the demand for skilled professionals in this field continues to rise. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, organizations are increasingly relying on experts who can protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of web applications. By mastering the skills taught in this course, prospective students can pursue a wide range of roles such as security analyst, penetration tester, cybersecurity consultant, or privacy officer. These positions are critical in safeguarding both personal and corporate information, and professionals in this field can expect high job security, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and technology.",
        "A real-world example of the importance of Web Security and Privacy can be seen in the 2017 Equifax data breach. This breach exposed the personal information of over 147 million people, including social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses. The breach was caused by an unpatched vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework, a popular web application framework used by Equifax. Hackers exploited this flaw, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. This incident highlights the critical need for professionals who can identify vulnerabilities, patch security gaps, and ensure that data privacy standards are maintained. Web Security and Privacy experts play a vital role in preventing such breaches by proactively securing web applications, testing for vulnerabilities, and safeguarding sensitive personal and organizational data from malicious attacks.",
