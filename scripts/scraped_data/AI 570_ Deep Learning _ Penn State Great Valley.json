        "Regression is a type of supervised learning. The term regression refers to a set of problems that aims to explain the relationship between one outcome variable (called dependent variables) and one or more independent variables (called predictor variables). For example, the house price prediction is a regression problem in which the house purchase price (dependent variable) can be estimated from predictors or variables such as the number of bedrooms, the lot size, and location etc. The overall idea of regression is to examine which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable.",

        "From an implementation perspective, a block is a Python class, which inherits from the tf.keras.Model that presents a block in Keras. A customized block class has the constructor function__init__(self) to perform the necessary initialization and the call()to define the forward propagation of the block, that is, how to obtain the required output based on the input.",
        "The block class must thus define the forward propagation function call()and must store any required weights and biases. It is worth noting that the block does not need to define the backpropagation function to compute the gradients. In fact, the block class will inherit the auto differentiation function from its parent (tf.keras.Model).",
        "You only need to define the code for the forward propagation function and manage the weights and biases (model parameters) if required by your customized block.",
