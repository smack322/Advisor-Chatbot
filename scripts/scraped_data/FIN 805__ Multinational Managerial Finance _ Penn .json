        "The three types of financial heading instruments are:",
        "We will direct our attention to forwards and futures and options, as these instruments will be beneficial from a multinational perspective. Swaps will be covered in another course in the program.",
        "The fundamental difference between a forward future contract and an option is that forward future contracts are obligations you must satisfy the contract at maturity. For options, you do not have the obligation.  Rather you have the right to exercise if it is favorable to you, or not exercise if you can get a better treatment in the market.  Click on the plus icons (+) in the image below for an example.",
        "As mentioned previously, the goal of a corporation is to maximize value while minimizing risk. A company must take into consideration the benefits of interest expense tax deductions as well as the costs of bankruptcy to determine a mixture of debt and equity that minimizes the firm’s cost of capital.",
        "When companies mix and match various sources of funding, there becomes a possibility of reaching a combination which is optimal. The Value Max (Vmax) corresponds to the WACC Min. WACC is a function of how much debt you have.  But what proportion of funding should come from debt and how much should come from equity?  That will lead to variations in the cost of capital.",
        "As shown in the image below, as your cost of equity goes up, your cost of debt goes up, and your WACC goes up.",
        "Initially, your WACC goes down when you increase debt, because you’re getting taxation benefits of interest tax deductibility on debt. But as you continue to increase debt, it goes back up. So that brings you closer towards bankruptcy. That makes it riskier.",
        "We also see, as you increase debt, your cost of equity starts going up. Because your beta, the variability of your stock return to that of the market return, goes up as well. So your asset beta goes up. Hence, your cost of equity goes up, as we increase debt.",
        "So, you see that with increasing debt, your Ke goes up , your WACC goes up , and your Kd goes up .",
        "Optimal Level",
        "The optimal for the WACC is the point where your WACC is at the minimum level. In the image above, it’s shown at the point of WACC Min.",
        "Correspondingly, the point where your WACC is at the minimum, is the point at which your Value is maximized (Max Val).  So a company should mix and match, to find an optimality.",
        "Kd and Ke can be choice variables to find optimality. These choice variables include:",
        "So given these two factors, multinationals are unique because they have an opportunity to find geography and find financially engineered instruments, as to where to list and what to list.",
        "Unique Characteristics Faced by MNCs",
        "According to the textbook, the four unique characteristic variables Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) must handle when going abroad are:",
        "Select each header below for more information:",
        "Multinationals have a larger investor base in addition to the ability to list in a more liquid market where source of funding is cheaper.  When they go abroad, they have a broader investor base that they have access to.",
        "Their sourcing of funding can be done at a cheaper rate, because there are more investors supplying the funds. Also, there is more liquid market. Not only is the investor base larger, but the trading activity, the liquidity might be better. Hence, going abroad might provide two simultaneous benefits of larger investor base and listing in a more liquid market, resulting in lower cost of capital.",
        "Multinationals can create value through international diversification. The revenue sources of multinational corporations are broad and diverse — they can get their revenue from China, from India, from Bangladesh, from Switzerland, from Pakistan, from Russia. Due to the fact that the cash flows or revenues are coming from many different markets, that means they are diversified.",
        "The fluctuations in one country’s revenues will be offset by the fluctuations in the other. So the dampening effect would be that the riskiness or the volatility of the cash flow will be lower. That would mean that for a multinational corporation with a diversified source of revenue, multinational corporations will have less risky source of revenue/cash flows. Hence, they may have a little better treatment at the hands of investors trying to invest their money in that company, because the company is less risky.",
        "However, MNCs do have additional risks. In particular, the foreign exchange risk. That will increase your cost of capital. So this might potentially decrease your WACC.",
        "Depending upon where you are listing abroad, the portfolio diversification theory does work in favor of MNCs. Because if greater number of companies are listing abroad, greater number of international investors have access to different company stocks and debts. So those expectations of more diversified portfolio from global investor perspective will have a bearing on whether a multinational is received positively or negatively, depending upon what the global investors have in terms of their expected risk, expected return, and their access to market instruments.",
        "So given the demand side of your portfolio, international portfolio investor expectations would also play a role. And in this sense, the WACC can go up or down depending upon various factors.",
        "At the completion of the course, you should be able to accomplish the following:",
        "In this lesson, you will explore the foundations of globalization and its impact on multinational enterprises (MNEs), focusing on how they create value, manage finances, and navigate their path toward global expansion.",

        "In this lesson, you will delve into the fundamentals of foreign exchange markets, understanding their structure, key participants, and the types of transactions that occur. You will also explore how foreign currency quotes are represented and interpreted in practice.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you will have a thorough understanding of the mechanics of foreign exchange markets, the roles of participants, and the practical application of currency quotes, preparing you for deeper insights into global financial operations.",
        "In this lesson, you will explore the foundational theories of Parity Conditions, focusing on purchasing power parity (PPP) and interest rate parity, along with their real-world implications in currency markets.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of how parity conditions affect exchange rates, price levels, and the behavior of international financial markets.",
        "In this lesson, you will learn about the various strategies and financial instruments used to hedge currency risk, focusing on how corporations manage their exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you should have a clear understanding of how companies use financial instruments like forwards, futures, and options to manage currency risk and protect against exchange rate volatility.",
        "In this lesson, you will explore the different types of currency exposure faced by businesses, including transaction, operating, and translation exposures, and understand how these exposures impact financial decision-making.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you should have a comprehensive understanding of transaction, operating, and translation exposures, and how businesses manage these risks to protect their financial interests in the global market.",
        "In this lesson, you will explore key concepts in cross-border investing, including global financial strategy, risk management, and how international capital markets influence investment decisions.",
        "By the end of this lesson, you will have a deeper understanding of how businesses and investors navigate the complexities of cross-border investments, manage risks, and apply financial models to global markets.",
        "In this lesson, you will examine the financing strategies used by businesses in international markets, focusing on optimal financial structures, managing foreign subsidiaries, and options for foreign equity listings.",
        "By the end of this lesson, students will have a comprehensive understanding of risk management practices in financial institutions, including the techniques used to manage credit and interest-rate risks, preparing them for advanced study in financial risk analysis and strategy.",
        "Multinational Managerial Finance offers prospective students a valuable opportunity to develop expertise in the financial management of global businesses. This course covers key concepts such as currency risk management, international capital budgeting, and the financing of multinational corporations, all of which are crucial for success in today’s interconnected economy. By understanding how financial markets operate across borders and how multinational firms manage their capital structures and investments, students will be well-prepared for careers in international banking, corporate finance, and consulting. Graduates of this course will have the analytical skills to make strategic financial decisions that drive growth and stability in global business environments.",
        "A real-world example of how the concepts learned in Multinational Managerial Finance can be applied is seen in the strategic decisions of multinational corporations like Coca-Cola. When Coca-Cola expanded into emerging markets, it had to navigate currency fluctuations, adjust its financial structure for subsidiaries, and optimize its capital investments in different countries. By applying the principles of multinational finance, Coca-Cola managed transaction and operating exposure, used hedging strategies to mitigate currency risks, and made decisions on financing foreign operations using a mix of debt and equity. This real-world application of concepts such as international capital budgeting, risk management, and financing strategies highlights the direct impact that the knowledge gained in FIN 805 can have on making effective financial decisions in global markets.",
