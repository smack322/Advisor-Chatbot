        "Students will be evaluated on different projects throughout the course, some individually and some with group work.",
        "*subject to change",
        "User roles are also not user groups. There are fulltime students, part-time students who workpart-time, part-time students who work fulltime, students who are parents, students who areveterans, etc. However, the set of goals they may want to do is the same, so it’s one user role,student. Unless there is at least one goal that only one group needs to do (and the other groupswould never need to do it), then it’s a single user role. The following illustration may help you:",
        "In this assignment, you’ll dive into hands-on design by creating a basic wireframe for a prototype using Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive. Working individually, you’ll explore Balsamiq’s tools and features to capture your initial design ideas for a main page and key user goals, developing valuable wireframing skills. This independent exercise encourages each student to bring a unique perspective to the project, and next week, you’ll have the opportunity to share and compare your design with your teammates, fostering a richer collaborative process.",
        "This assignment has two parts.",
        "Go to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative web page, Diversity of Web Users – How Peoplewith Disabilities Use the Web, at https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/diversity.Each student must read the Diversity of abilities section (press the plus key [+] to expand it.)Then each student must select one of the disability categories from those listed (Auditory,Cognitive and neurological, Physical, Speech, or Visual.) The category you select must bedifferent than the ones your teammates select (so while you must do your own work, you must coordinate category selection with them).
