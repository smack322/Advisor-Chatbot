        "LEAD 862: Strategic Leadership is a three-credit course that offers a deep dive into the critical requirements for effective strategic leadership in organizations. Focused on the role of executive leaders, this course examines their influence on organizational success and the creation of wealth through a balanced scorecard framework.",
        "Through a combination of selected readings, case studies, and real-world insights from senior managers and administrators, students will explore the multifaceted challenges of strategic leadership. Topics include strategic planning, marketing, employee selection and training, organizational learning and development, and systems innovation. The course also delves into the strategic leadership system, emphasizing the interplay between the organizational context, a leader’s personal and professional attributes, and follower perceptions.",
        "The course integrates these elements into a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing strategic leadership capabilities. By the end of the course, students will possess a nuanced understanding of how strategic leaders foster financial success and drive organizational growth, equipping them with practical skills and knowledge applicable to real-world leadership challenges.",
        "LEAD 862 explores and analyzes the requirements for effective strategic leadership in organizations. Strategic leadership examines the role of executive leaders and their effects on organizations. The primary role of executives is to foster financial success and create wealth in organizations. This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the requirements for effective strategic leadership in organizations as assessed by the balanced scorecard. The challenges of strategic leadership involve strategic planning, marketing products and services, selecting and training employees, facilitating organizational learning and development, and developing systems to support operations, innovation, and human resources. These outcomes are lead indicators of financial success and wealth creation in organizations. Students will be given an overview of the various elements of the strategic leadership system, including organizational context/environment, the leader’s lifestream of biographic and demographic elements influencing leadership, and followers’ perceptions of the leader’s behavior. Emphasis in this course is placed on learning from “real world” senior managers/administrators to enhance the practicality and usefulness of the material covered in the course. As the course progresses, new knowledge and skills are integrated into a more sophisticated framework for understanding strategic leadership.",

        "Every time former Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced an exciting new technology product, there was a strategic reason for it. Whether it was to create an entirely new market, leverage a market niche that hadn’t been filled, or push innovation to its limits, Jobs, like most top executives, was driven by a specific purpose or strategy.",
        "Singh and Useem (2016, p. 41) define organizational strategy as “setting the firm’s general direction and identifying what creates sustainable value and advantage for the firm.”",
        "While considering strategy, executive leaders, like Jobs, recognize that internal organizational changes must keep pace with what is happening in the external environment. As Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, once said “When the rate of change outside exceeds the rate of change inside, the end is in sight.”",
        "Leaders serve as the main role models for change and provide the motivation and communication to keep change efforts focused and moving forward, as Tim Cook, current CEO of Apple describes in the following video.",
        "In gathering information to feed into the strategic planning analyses shown in Step 4 of Figure 4.1, the task force performs an internal analysis. By studying the company’s internal environment, the task force can determine what they do best. They focus on examining their unique resources and assets as well as the competencies their employees possess. The identification of such resources and assets allows them to determine their sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace (McGahan, 1999). The typical materials reviewed in this process are listed in the following video:",
        "Notice that the key steps in this process focus on identifying strengths and weaknesses, capabilities, and competitive advantage (i.e., condition or circumstance that puts a company in a favorable or superior business position).  Figure 4.3 shows the specific components of internal analysis used in the resource-based above-average return model.",
        "In early 2018, it was revealed that millions of Facebook users’ personal information had been previously shared with Cambridge Analytica for the purported use of influencing the 2016 U. S. presidential election. When the word first hit Wall Street, Facebook’s stock plummeted and it seemed that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was nowhere to be found. The general public demanded accountability for such a violation of users’ personal information security. At the same time, shareholders demanded answers as to how such a blunder could occur at one of the most popularly traded companies. In a tardy response to these calls for action, Zuckerberg relied on COO Sheryl Sandberg to lead a public relations initiative to provide explanations for what went wrong, and how Facebook would ensure that the data breach would never happen again (Aiello, 2018, April 5). Sandberg’s response is shown in the following video:",
