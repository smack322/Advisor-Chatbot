        "INSC 846: Network Predictive Analytics is a three-credit course divided into three parts, focusing on network analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using the R programming language. The first part introduces network representation, manipulation, and visualization, leveraging R libraries to efficiently handle large datasets. The second part delves into exploratory social network analysis, examining topological features, community detection, and the roles of key actors to understand network resilience and efficiency. The final section explores the implications of network structures, using models to predict information dissemination and behaviors. Students apply these techniques to real-world scenarios such as intelligence gathering, criminal network analysis, and security threat prediction, gaining valuable insights into how networks shape societal functions.",
        "The course is divided into three parts:",
        "R language and several of its libraries are used throughout the course for analyzing network models to detect and capture the dynamic patterns of group membership, understanding how these communities facilitate communication, coordination, and cooperation, and how network and predictive analytics can be used in intelligence gathering for detecting criminal behavior, understanding the evolution of criminal networks and predicting security threats.",
        "The objective of this course is to provide a foundation in the principles of network and predictive analytics along with hands-on experience with the R language for studying the interrelatedness of cyber-social and cyber-technical aspects of our society as a whole that have transformed physical communities into virtual communities. Students who complete this course should be able to:",

        "A grade is given on the basis of the instructor’s judgment as to the student’s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). The following grading system applies to graduate students:",
        "Grades will be based on the following scale:",
        "A = 95-100, A- = 90-94, B+ = 87-89, B = 84-86, B- = 80-83, C+ = 77-79, C = 70- 6, D = 60-69, and F = Below 60.",
        "The idea behind the course project is to apply the principles and techniques you are learning this semester to represent, manipulate, visualize, and analyze a network data set on a topic of broad interest such as covert networks, spread of disease, dissemination of information, and how markets function.

        "A few basic reminders:",
        "*Subject to change",
        "Humans live in a connected world. Everything from social media to institutions (such as a government), processes (such as an economy), and infrastructures (such as a global airline network) form a complex network. But humans are not unique in being part of an interconnected system. We see complex networks in an entire ecosystem, interacting genes and communicating neurons. Network-based perspective, therefore, has been found to be useful in the study of complex systems in:",
        "There has also been a growing interest in sciences in the recent past to move away from the reductionist approach that focused on studying fundamental parts of a complex system. A system-level perspective considers a system as more than a sum of its parts and tries to understand emergent behavior that results from the interation of these parts.",
        "For this course, our interest will be in economic, political and social interactions shaped by social networks. Social networks play an important role in trade of goods and services, how we vote, how much education we obtain, whether we become criminals or succeed professionally. The myriad of ways in which a social network affects our lives raises many important questions:",
        "We will try to answer these questions over the next several weeks during this course.",
        "Basic topographical measures such as size, average distance, and diameter provide information on a network as an aggregate, giving analysts an ability to gauge the overall potential of the network in terms of capacity and performance and also providing a context within which to interpret other measures that may come further down the analysis pipeline. Table 1 provides a summary of these measures.",
        "Network size is simply a count of the number of actors in a network. Knowing a network’s size is important when interpreting measures sensitive to it, such as density or diameter. For instance, it is meaningless to compare densities of networks that are dissimilar in size.",
        "Size can also be used to understand if a network is growing or shrinking over time. A dark network that is consistently growing is likely recruiting successfully. Analysts should be careful, however, and understand how the boundaries of a network have been defined or else they may not be looking at the true size of the network.",
        "Average distance places more emphasis on the ties between actors within a network. It is measured as the average length of all the shortest paths or geodesics between all actors in a network. It provides an analyst with a means to determine how fast information can spread throughout a given network.",
        "All things being equal, networks with lower average distance should be more efficient in diffusing information and resources than those with a higher average distance. This information can be used to formulate a deception campaign strategy that relies on spreading disinformation to undermine the operations of a dark network. However, care has to be taken with the timing of such campaigns since networks are dynamic and the average distance of a network is likely to change with time.",
        "Network diameter measures a network’s longest geodesic and indicates how dispersed a network is. Networks with large diameters may be more dispersed than those with small ones. Dispersed or decentralized networks are better suited to solving complex and challenging problems while maintaining their operational security when compared to more centralized or hierarchical networks. However, since a network diameter is closely related to its size, we should be careful when comparing diameters of networks of different sizes.",
        "The basic topographical measures highlight some tradeoffs that dark networks may face and provide evidence for the potential of these networks. These relationships, however, may not be as clear cut and, therefore, these measures should, at first blush, be used just as an evidence of potential. For instance, a network with small average distance could be vulnerable to misinformation campaigns but could equally prevent disinformation from spreading among its members.",
        "The small-world network model was introduced by Watts and Strogatz who observed that many networks in the real world display high level of clustering with small distances between nodes. This observation cannot be explained using random network models that, despite small distances between nodes (diameter of random networks are on the order of O(log n)), show very little clustering (clustering coefficient is proportional to n-1).",
        "In order to create a model that closely aligned with their observation, Watts and Strogatz suggested to first create a network with a lattice structure. In this structure, first a set of n vertices are arranged such that each vertex is connected to r of its neighbors. Next, for each edge, independently and with probability p, one end of the edge is moved to be incident on another vertex. This new vertex is chosen uniformly randomly with attention to avoid construction of loops and multi-edges. The intent is to:",
        "Figure 5 shows a lattice structure with high clustering and high diameter along with the effect of rewiring a few links.",
        "The picture is not quite what we observe in the real world but it can be used to answer questions surrounding networks where we have high clustering and low diameter.",
        "Students who complete this course should be able to:",

Security teams use network predictive analytics to analyze the structure of network traffic and identify unusual patterns that may signal a potential breach, such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. By analyzing historical data and applying predictive models, the system can forecast where and when an attack might occur, allowing for proactive measures to be taken before any damage is done. Additionally, predictive analytics can be used to identify key nodes or actors within the network who may be critical to the overall security, helping organizations prioritize their resources and prevent security threats before they escalate.",
