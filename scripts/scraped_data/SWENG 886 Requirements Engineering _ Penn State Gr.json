        "One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering.",
        "To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering.",
