        "Peer Review Evaluation: Peer assessment is a valuable tool for me to evaluate the individual contributions of team members. While I will be able to evaluate your individual contributions primarily from observations of your postings and chats, the assessment provides additional information on what might take place outside those meetings. It is important and I urge you to take it seriously. It’s not a popularity contest. It’s a frank, honest assessment. I’m also requiring that you provide an assessment of your own contribution. Again, be honest. I’m not looking for modesty. If you feel you made the most valuable contributions to the group go ahead and evaluate it that way.",
        "There will be one final exam that will use Honorlock Proctoring.",
        "This course may require you to take exams using certain proctoring software that uses your computer’s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record your activity during exams. The proctoring software, Honorlock, may be listening to you, monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, and recording any activity (including visual and audio recordings) during the proctoring process. By enrolling in this course, you consent to the use of the proctoring software, including but not limited to any audio and/or visual monitoring that may be recorded. Please contact your instructor with any questions. For Honorlock resources and a practice test, see the Honorlock Information module in Canvas.",
