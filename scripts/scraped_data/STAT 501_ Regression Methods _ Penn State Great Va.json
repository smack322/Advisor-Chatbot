        "STAT 501: Regression Methods is a three-credit course designed to provide a practical, hands-on introduction to applied linear regression techniques. This course emphasizes not only the technical aspects of regression modeling but also the critical skills of data analysis and interpretation.",
        "Regression methods are a powerful statistical toolkit for understanding the relationships between a response variable (dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (predictor variables). By the end of this course, you will gain valuable experience in constructing, analyzing, and interpreting regression models, preparing you to apply these techniques effectively in real-world scenarios.",
        "Analysis of research data through simple and multiple regression and correlation; polynomial models; indicator variables; step-wise, piece-wise, and logistic regression. This course is cohort-based, which means that there is an established start and end date, and that you will interact with other students and the instructor throughout the course.",
        "STAT 501 is an applied linear regression course that emphasizes data analysis and interpretation. Generally, statistical regression is a collection of methods for determining and using models that explain how a response variable (dependent variable) relates to one or more explanatory variables (predictor variables).",
        "Stat 500 or equivalent; matrix algebra. Students enrolling for this course should have taken at least one other statistics course and should be conversant with the basic fundamentals of statistical testing and estimation. You also should have a rudimentary knowledge of matrices. Students who do not meet these prerequisites after being informed in writing by the instructor may be dis-enrolled during the first 10-day free add-drop period. If you have not completed the listed prerequisites, then promptly consult with the instructor if you have not done so already.",

This first half of the 5th edition text is available published as Applied Linear Regression Models by Kutner, Nachtsheim, and Neter (4th edition).",
        "Students may use either textbook listed as they are identical.",
        "The larger Applied Linear Statistical Models also includes 16 chapters on analysis of variance and experimental design not covered in this course, however, these topics are covered in STAT 502 where these chapters are required. Students may consider purchasing the larger text if they are taking both courses.",
        "To obtain the textbook, click on the “view course materials” link in Lion Path. That will take you to the World Campus materials page for the course which will have a link to the online bookstore.",
        "You will need Minitab statistical software to replicate examples from the notes and textbook and to be able to do the lesson assignments. Further details are available on the STAT Online Statistical Software pageLinks to an external site.. No support is provided in this course for other software such as R, but if you have extensive experience with other software, you may use this if you would prefer.",

You DO NOT need to create an account or schedule an appointment in advance. Honorlock is available 24/7, and all that is required is a computer, a working webcam/microphone, your ID, and a stable internet connection.",
        "This course will be conducted entirely online. There will be no set class meeting times, but you will be required to complete weekly lesson assignments with specific due dates as well as two midterm exams, a project, and a final exam. The assessments are open for multiple days, so it is your responsibility to complete the work early if you plan to travel or participate in national holidays, religious observances or University approved activities. If you need to request an exception due to a personal or medical emergency, contact me directly as soon as you are able. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.",
        "The lesson assignments are a way for you to practice and receive feedback on the concepts covered in the lessons. Lesson assignments are to be submitted online by 11:59 pm Eastern Time on Sundays. Please note that the last lesson assignment is due on a Saturday. The assignments may span one or two lessons. The lesson assignments are worth 30% of your overall grade.",
        "Exams 1 and 2 are proctored using Honorlock and have to be completed within a 2-hour time period that you have pre-scheduled during the exam period. Each exam is worth 20% of your overall grade. One thing to remember is that the 2-hour time limit begins when you start the exam. You can’t start it in the morning and get to it in the afternoon! The timer starts as soon as you click the “Start” button, so don’t click it until you’re ready. Even if you close the internet browser the clock will keep running. Canvas will report how long it took to complete the exam. After 2 hours the quiz will close and you will no longer be able to submit. You will only have one attempt to take the exam.",
        "The project is to be submitted online by 11:59pm Eastern Time on the project due date listed in the Course Schedule. You will have 3 weeks to complete the project. The project is worth 10% of your overall grade.",

        "Because the other terms are used less frequently today, we’ll use the “predictor” and “response” terms to refer to the variables encountered in this course. The other terms are mentioned only to make you aware of them should you encounter them in other arenas. Simple linear regression gets its adjective “simple,” because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable. In contrast, multiple linear regression, which we study later in this course, gets its adjective “multiple,” because it concerns the study of two or more predictor variables.",
        "efore proceeding, we must clarify what types of relationships we won’t study in this course, namely, deterministic (or functional) relationships. Here is an example of a deterministic relationship.",
        "When conducting a residual analysis, a “residuals versus fits plot” is the most frequently created plot. It is a scatter plot of residuals on the y-axis and fitted values (estimated responses) on the x-axis. The plot is used to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers.",
        "Let’s look at an example to see what a “well-behaved” residual plot looks like. Some researchers (Urbano-Marquez, et al., 1989) were interested in determining whether or not alcohol consumption was linearly related to muscle strength. The researchers measured the total lifetime consumption of alcohol (x) on a random sample of n = 50 alcoholic men. They also measured the strength (y) of the deltoid muscle in each person’s non-dominant arm. A fitted line plot of the resulting data, (Alcohol Arm data), looks like this:",
        "The plot suggests that there is a decreasing linear relationship between alcohol and arm strength. It also suggests that there are no unusual data points in the data set. And, it illustrates that the variation around the estimated regression line is constantly suggesting that the assumption of equal error variances is reasonable.",
        "First, we will illustrate Minitab’s “Best Subsets” procedure and a “by hand” calculation of the information criteria from earlier. Recall from Lesson 6 that this dataset consists of variables possibly relating to blood pressures of n = 39 Peruvians who have moved from rural high-altitude areas to urban lower-altitude areas (Peru dataset). The variables in this dataset (where we have omitted the calf skinfold variable from the first time we used this example) are:",
        "Again, follow Stat > Regression > Regression > Best Subsets in Minitab. The results of this procedure are presented below.",
        "To interpret the results, we start by noting that the lowest Cp value (= 5.5) occurs for the five-variable model that includes the variables Age, Years, fraclife, Weight, and Chin.",
