        "ACCTG 800: Financial & Managerial Accounting provides an essential introduction to the principles of financial and managerial accounting, emphasizing the interpretation, evaluation, and practical use of accounting information rather than its production. The course is designed for prospective students who aim to understand how accounting data informs decision-making for both external stakeholders (e.g., investors and regulators) and internal users (e.g., managers). Key topics include analyzing an organization’s financial position, planning short- and long-term activities, motivating behavior, evaluating performance, and addressing corporate governance issues. Students will also explore foundational managerial accounting concepts, gaining insights into how accounting influences strategic and operational decisions.",
        "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to both financial accounting (focusing on external users of accounting information) and managerial accounting (focusing on internal users of accounting information).  The course focuses on the uses (and potential misuses) of accounting information.  We will also discuss corporate governance issues.  Accounting information can be used to evaluate an organization’s financial position, to plan future activities (short and long-term), to motivate behavior, and to evaluate performance.  The focus is NOT to train students to produce accounting information.  Rather, the focus is to train students to interpret, evaluate, and use accounting information. We will also introduce managerial accounting topics in this course.",

Accordingly, it is the policy of the University that class attendance by students be encouraged and that all instructors organize and conduct their courses with this policy in mind. A student should attend every class for which the student is scheduled and should be held responsible for all work covered in the courses taken. In each case, the instructor should decide when the class absence constitutes a danger to the student’s scholastic attainment and should make this fact known to the student at once. A student whose irregularity in attendance causes the student, in the judgment of the instructor, to become deficient scholastically may run the risk of receiving a failing grade or receiving a lower grade than the student might have secured had the student been in regular attendance.",

By mastering financial statements, cost analysis, and performance evaluation tools like the balanced scorecard, students are prepared for roles in accounting, finance, and business management. This course enhances career prospects by enabling students to effectively communicate financial insights to both internal and external stakeholders, guiding strategic decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and driving organizational performance. As financial and managerial accounting is foundational in almost every industry, the skills gained from this course open doors to diverse career opportunities in areas such as auditing, financial planning, and managerial accounting.",
        "In ACCTG 800, students learn to apply accounting concepts to real-world scenarios. For example, consider a company like Apple Inc., which uses financial accounting to report quarterly earnings to investors, helping them assess the company’s financial health through income statements and balance sheets. At the same time, Apple’s managers use managerial accounting to analyze cost behavior and set pricing strategies for new products. By using cost-volume-profit analysis, they determine how many units of a product need to be sold to break even and achieve profitability. Through this course, students learn to interpret and analyze such reports, making them valuable assets in any organization, capable of guiding financial decisions and strategic planning.",
