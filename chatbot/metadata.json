One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Course Topics Unlocking Your PotentialHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticsrequirements engineering processes and practices, requirements elicitation techniques, quality metrics and methods for requirements specifications, applications of formal methods to requirements engineering, agile software development methodologies and their use in software and systems requirements engineering, management considerations for requirements engineering, and a value driven approach to requirements tradeoff analysis.Requirements Engineering for Software and Systems, Fourth Edition, by Philip A.

The BPM methodology demonstrated in Figure 2.1 takes a project-oriented view for developing business process applications. The different phases in the BPM methodology include: Select the information buttons\u00a0\u00a0in the image below for a description of these phases. Try to define these terms in your own words before turning the card to see the correct answer. In the BPMN, control flow is also called as sequence flow which is represented as an arrow between the flow objects such as the\u00a0events,\u00a0activities\u00a0and the\u00a0gateways. There are different types of sequence flows, namely normal flow, exception flow, sequence flow induced by link events, and adhoc flow. A normal flow of a business process represents an expected and desired behavior of the process. It starts in the start event and continues through a set of flow objects until it reaches the end event. Exceptional situations are reached by exception flow. With respect to the process enactment, the exception flow does not define the desired flow of the process, but exceptional situations. Exception flow is created by intermediate events attached to the boundary of an activity. Each intermediate event of this kind is associated with an event context, used to determine whether the event will occur. The intermediate event will spawn only the exception flow if the activity that the intermediate event is attached to is still active when the event occurs. In figure 8.7, a business process involving a brainstorming session is shown. Once the room for the brainstorming session is reserved, the brainstorming session starts. This activity provides the event context for the intermediate timer event that is attached to its boundary. This session is limited to three hours. When the brainstorming session activity starts, the timer is started. When three hours has elapsed, an intermediate event is generated. If at this point in time the brainstorming activity is still active, an exception is raised, the brainstorming activity is completed, and the process continues with the consolidation of results activity. If the brainstorming sessions last less than three hours, the result consolidation activity is conducted as part of the normal sequence flow. In this case, the event context is no longer present when the intermediate timer event occurs (see figure 7). During this course students will: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

Emphasizing creativity, cognitive processes, and problem-solving techniques, this course empowers students to navigate complex challenges with innovation and strategic clarity. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, students explore how creativity and structure can work together to drive effective solutions. Topics include cognitive function, styles of problem solving, and the nuanced role of structure, all of which lay a critical foundation for advanced courses like SYSEN 552. In addition to theory, SYSEN 850 incorporates hands-on activities and case studies across engineering, science, and management fields, ensuring students can apply their learning in real-world settings. By analyzing change as a catalyst and learning to manage diverse problem-solving approaches within teams, students will leave the course with a refined toolkit of adaptive strategies and collaborative skills. This course is ideal for students looking to build versatile, interdisciplinary skills in problem solving, making them well-prepared to lead and innovate in the complex landscape of Engineering Management. This course provides students with the socio-technical foundations needed to address the interdisciplinary, integrative, and collaborative aspects of Engineering Management; this foundation will be developed further in SYSEN 552. This course will address fundamental principles of individual problem solving, creativity, and the process of change, establishing a solid and rigorous core of facilitating concepts and language that will be useful throughout the program. To serve this purpose, selected elements of cognitive psychology will be examined, along with general and domain-specific models of problem solving and change processes, a range of problem solving techniques, and illustrative examples of these (and other) key topics in a variety of contexts. Specific coverage will include: Students entering this class are assumed to have\u00a0no\u00a0previous expertise in cognitive psychology or any other related social science. The course is designed to provide a basic yet thorough introduction to problem solving from the individual perspective, including the diverse ways in which people respond to and seek to bring about change. It serves as the prerequisite for\u00a0SYSEN 552: Creativity and Problem Solving II, where principles of collaborative problem solving will be examined. The fundamental objective of this course is to help students become better and more effective problem solvers through a clear understanding of the cognitive processes involved in individual problem solving and creative activity. Students who complete this course successfully will be able to: M. J.

You can access the E-Book through the Library Resources link on the course navigation. You may choose to use the E-Book as an alternative to purchasing a physical copy of the text. For questions or issues, contact the University Libraries Reserve Help (UL-RESERVESHELP@LISTS.PSU.EDU). Grades\u00a0will be based on the following scale: A = 95 \u2013 100, A- = 90 \u2013 94, B+ = 87 \u2013 89, B = 84 \u2013 86, B- = 80 \u2013 83, C+ = 77 \u2013 79, C = 70 \u2013 76, D = 60 \u2013 69, and F = 60 and below. There will be a discussion forum associated with each lesson. You are required to log on to\u00a0every\u00a0discussion forum and to post\u00a0at least\u00a0one original response related to the assigned topic as well as a minimum of two substantive responses (in general) to your classmates postings. The specific posting requirements will be included along with the discussion topic for each forum. You are not required to follow threads from previous lessons, but you are always welcome to post comments that relate to any previous discussion if it also relates to the current theme in some way. Your instructor will monitor all discussion forums and will participate in them throughout the course to evaluate your performance every week and provide feedback (as a group and/or on an individual basis). Your formal grade for discussion forum performance will be calculated based on the\u00a0number\u00a0of postings you make\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0quality\u00a0of your comments (e.g., degree of advanced thinking, quality of communication). There will be two written assignments during the course:\u00a0Reflection & Synthesis (R&S) #1 \u2013 #2. These are due at the end of Lessons 2 and 5, respectively. The purpose of these assignments is to help you reflect upon, analyze, synthesize, and apply the material covered in this course. You are welcome to work together in the\u00a0early\u00a0stages of these assignments (e.g., discussing your ideas, pondering approaches, recommending references), but the final product must be\u00a0entirely\u00a0your own individual work. In completing each assignment, you are expected to submit neat, organized, and complete written documents that demonstrate higher order thinking and good communication skills (i.e., the quality of your writing\u00a0will\u00a0be assessed). Typed assignments (1.5 line spacing or double-spaced; 12-point font; 1\u2033 margins; and citations following either the APA or MLA format) are required. Each written assignment is worth a total of 100 points and 20% of your course grade. Of these 100 points, 80 points will be used to assess the content of your response (e.g., have you completed the required task, the depth of your analysis), while the remaining 20 points will be used to assess the quality of your communication (e.g., your writing \u2013 grammar, spelling, punctuation, clarity of expression, etc.). There will be two exams:\u00a0one midterm exam\u00a0(20% of course grade) and\u00a0one final exam\u00a0(20% of course grade). The purpose of these exams is to ensure your ready recall of fundamental concepts and key points covered in this course; they will not focus on minute detail (e.g., no dates). In terms of format, all exams will be primarily (if not completely) multiple choice, with the possibility of a few short answer questions. All\u00a0exams will be given as\u00a0timed\u00a0online\u00a0exams, offered within prescribed windows of opportunity during the appropriate week. You will have a restricted amount of time to complete each exam once you have begun it \u2013 i.e., you will not be able to \u201cpause\u201d or \u201csave\u201d the exam and return to it later.\u00a0All exams are to be completed\u00a0without\u00a0the collaboration or assistance of any other individuals, including other students, and without access to previous copies of any exam from this course. You will be \u201con your honor\u201d to follow these requirements; evidence of cheating will be dealt with according to Penn State Academic Integrity policies. Both exams will be proctored online using proctoring software that uses your computer\u2019s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record your activity during exams. The proctoring software may be listening to you, monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, and recording any activity (including visual and audio recordings) during the proctoring process. *subject to change Here, we are dealing fundamentally with\u00a0reason, as opposed to\u00a0reflex\u00a0or\u00a0instinct\u00a0as mentioned above. This schema is not a physiological diagram; instead, it shows the brain\u2019s functioning as departments of an organization whose primary aim is self-survival (imagine a boardroom of 100 billion neurons, looking after 100 trillion other cells!). Note the three main elements of cognition: as well as these other important terms:\u00a0Behavior, Environment, and\u00a0Product. Now we will consider the basic functions, roles, and relationships of and between all of the above. First, Cognitive Affect selects the problem (opportunity) to solve out of all those available (however they have come to our attention) and determines the kind of solution needed or desired, includ\u00ading the means that are acceptable for attaining it. So, for example, you might be asked to produce a particular circuit assembly in half the usual time, but without sacrificing quality. Or, you might have to defend yourself against an attacker, but choose to disarm the person rather than kill him. These choices are driven by\u00a0motive, another of the four principal elements of problem solving. Note the subtext in this portion of the schema \u2013 i.e., I WANT \u2013 which describes motive in its most general form. Freud (an Austrian who founded psychoanalysis) separated \u201cI WANT\u201d into three specific parts: I NEED \u2013 I LIKE \u2013 I OUGHT. I NEED is the imperative \u2013 I must find the solution or die. I LIKE comes into play when I have options and can choose the solution I prefer (assuming it is available). I OUGHT operates when I am willing to postpone an immediate reward for a later, \u201chigher\u201d reward (e.g., for the sake of others, the team); I OUGHT helps us collaborate with those (needed) others and provides a reason for the development of ethics. All these forms of motive will be reflected in what I KNOW (Cognitive Resource), since the opportunities (problems) I choose to tackle (based on motive) will determine the knowledge and experience I need to gain (and will pursue). Once the problem (opportunity) has been chosen via Cognitive Affect, Cognitive Effect carries out the detailed problem solving process, i.e., it plans a problem\u2019s solution through to implementation (I PLAN). This process is enabled and limited by one\u2019s: More specifically,\u00a0potential cognitive level\u00a0(\u201cat what level\u201d) refers to one\u2019s innate capacity for problem solving; it is measured by such means as intelligence, talent, and/or the degree of complexity one can handle.\u00a0Cognitive\u00a0style\u00a0(\u201cin what way\u201d) refers to the preferred and stable manner in which a person responds to and seeks to bring about change (including the solution of problems); style can also be measured along a number of dimensions, including Adaption-Innovation, Introversion-Extraversion, etc. Level\u00a0and\u00a0style\u00a0are\u00a0independent, a fact we will simply state now, with proofs provided later (in Lesson 3). We also note that style is established early in life (by one\u2019s mid-teens, if not sooner) and does not change \u2013 i.e., style is\u00a0fixed. So, just as style is independent from capacity (i.e., level), style is also\u00a0not\u00a0behavior, which is flexible (through coping behavior \u2013 which is learned; see more on Behavior below). Finally, Cognitive Resource contains and processes the accumulated knowledge, skills, and experience of the individual (I KNOW). This is\u00a0manifest\u00a0level (what you actually know about different things \u2013 e.g., engineering, playing an instrument, foreign languages, etc.), as opposed to\u00a0potential\u00a0level (your capacity to know, which is housed in Cognitive Effect). Here is a simple analogy:\u00a0potential level\u00a0describes the size (and shape) of the cognitive \u201cbucket\u201d that is your brain;\u00a0manifest level\u00a0describes the contents of that bucket. Cognitive Resource is your \u201cbackroom powerhouse\u201d that influences the scope of all other operations; it continues to digest and manipulate its contents at all times (even as we sleep) \u2013 accumulating events, and by learning, turning them into experience, and by further learning, transforming experience into theory (whether one uses this term or not). Brought to bear throughout the problem solving process, it is the accumulation of the results from\u00a0all\u00a0previous problem solving activities, as well as feedback from the environment. Some techniques are intended to release\u00a0potential\u00a0capacity, i.e., to help us utilize more of the capacity we were born with or to utilize it more effectively. So, for example, if your idea generation is blocked, you might do something that relaxes you \u2013 e.g., take a walk around the block, go driving in your car, take a nap, etc. \u2013 i.e., something aimed at reducing the fatigue or anxiety that may be impeding the best use of your capacity (rather like \u201chelping\u201d your computer by restarting it). Or, if you are distracted (say, by too much noise or too many stimuli), you might go find a quiet place to do your work, break things down into small pieces, or do the parts that require the least concentration. These techniques are all examples of things we can do to release additional\u00a0potential\u00a0level\u00a0(from within our existing store); they don\u2019t solve the problem you are working on directly, but they may enable you to do so later or more efficiently. Recall the\u00a0processes\u00a0associated with Cognitive Resource \u2013 i.e.,\u00a0Learning\u00a0and\u00a0Memory. Techniques to enhance manifest level can be used to impact the effectiveness of either or both of these. So, enhancing\u00a0manifest\u00a0level\u00a0refers to increasing how\u00a0much\u00a0we learn (and retain) and how\u00a0quickly\u00a0we learn it, as well as how much of it we\u00a0recall\u00a0and how quickly/effectively we recall it. There are many different kinds of techniques aimed at enhancing manifest level. One example is\u00a0mnemonics, which include\u00a0acronyms\u00a0(e.g., \u201cROY G BIV\u201d for colors of the rainbow \u2013 Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet),\u00a0acrostics\u00a0(\u201cEvery Good Boy Does Fine\u201d for the G-clef notes on sheet music), and\u00a0rhymes. For many more examples, search the Web using \u201cmnemonic devices\u201d or \u201cmnemonic techniques\u201d as keywords.\u00a0Another example is the group of methods called \u201cspeed reading\u201d techniques; these enable a person to work through more written information in less time, with a higher level of retention. Since techniques aimed at enhancing manifest level improve actual (level) performance, they increase one\u2019s problem solving effectiveness directly. It is appropriate to consider once again the larger context of problem solving and how the specific material we have been learning fits into this strategic view. To support this exercise, refer to the Table below as we discuss the progression of theoretical elements, fundamental aims, practical entry points, and personal insights that guide our study along the path from the individual problem solver to problem solving teams and, ultimately, to problem solving leadership.

A Master\u2019s in Systems Engineering with a focus on SYSEN 850: Creativity and Problem Solving uniquely equips graduates to tackle complex, interdisciplinary challenges across industries. This course hones critical thinking, innovative problem-solving, and adaptability\u2014key skills for engineers tasked with managing dynamic projects. By mastering creative techniques, cognitive styles, and structured problem-solving approaches, graduates become proficient in viewing systems holistically, addressing interconnected issues, and driving solutions that are both effective and sustainable. For systems engineers, these skills translate to a competitive edge in roles that require balancing technical expertise with strategic insight, such as systems architecture, project management, and technical consulting. The ability to apply creativity within structured processes and to manage cognitive diversity within teams prepares graduates to lead high-impact projects, innovate under pressure, and navigate the complexity of modern engineering environments with confidence and agility. In the aerospace industry, the design and development of next-generation unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a complex, interdisciplinary challenge that requires systems engineers to blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving. For instance, an aerospace company tasked with meeting stringent government requirements for performance, safety, and sustainability must balance competing priorities such as fuel efficiency, payload capacity, and environmental compliance. Using structured problem-solving techniques from SYSEN 850, systems engineers can effectively tackle these challenges. Divergent and convergent thinking approaches allow the team to brainstorm innovative hybrid propulsion systems while refining ideas to ensure feasibility within the project constraints. Managing a multidisciplinary team of mechanical engineers, software developers, and environmental scientists adds another layer of complexity. Differences in problem-solving styles and cognitive approaches can lead to inefficiencies or conflicts if not properly managed. Leveraging the tools taught in SYSEN 850, such as cognitive diversity audits and the KAI framework, the project manager can align team roles to capitalize on individual strengths. This enables seamless collaboration and ensures that adaptive and innovative thinkers contribute effectively to their respective domains, fostering a balanced and productive team dynamic. By applying holistic systems thinking, systems engineers address the interconnected nature of UAV subsystems\u2014propulsion, materials, navigation, and compliance\u2014ensuring they work harmoniously without compromising performance. Techniques such as the Spiral of Change model help the team navigate evolving requirements and constraints, allowing iterative progress even under uncertainty. As a result, the UAV design not only meets but exceeds government efficiency and sustainability goals, positioning the company as a leader in the market. This real-world application underscores how SYSEN 850 equips graduates with the skills to lead high-impact projects, drive innovation, and manage complexity confidently across industries. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley The Management of Diversity in the Context of Change Unlocking Your Potential Techniques for Enhancing LevelHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsCognitive function: the brain\u2019s organization of problem solving Links between creativity, problem solving, and decision making Principal elements of problem solving: opportunity, motive, level, and style The critical role of structure in problem solving Problem solving processes and techniques Individual assessment of problem solving style The catalytic nature of change The management of problem solving diversity and change Problem solving teams and problem solving leadership (introduction) Case studies and examples (in science, engineering, management, etc.)Explain how problem solving works from an individual cognitive perspective Explain the links between problem solving, creativity, and decision making Recognize and appreciate their own respective problem solving abilities and styles Understand and appreciate the diverse problem solving abilities and styles of others Describe, using real-world examples, the impact of cognitive diversity in engineering Analyze, evaluate, and apply problem solving processes and techniques Analyze real-world examples of scientific and technological changeThe Organization of Problem Solving Paradigms and the Paradox of Structure Style, Level, Process, and Technique (Part I) Style, Level, Process, and Technique (Part II) Links between Theory and Practice (Part I) Links between Theory and Practice (Part II) The Management of Diversity in the Context of ChangeCognitive Function Schema Techniques for Enhancing Level Problem Solving CollaborationCognitive Affect Cognitive Effect Cognitive Resource(Potential) Cognitive Level (Preferred) Cognitive StyleExplain how problem solving works from an individual cognitive perspective Explain the links between problem solving, creativity, and decision making Recognize and appreciate their own respective problem solving abilities and styles Understand and appreciate the diverse problem solving abilities and styles of others Describe, using real-world examples, the impact of cognitive diversity in engineering Analyze, evaluate, and apply problem solving processes and techniques Analyze real-world examples of scientific and technological changeL1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7Introduction to Problem-Solving Fundamentals: Importance of cognitive style in shaping individual and team problem-solving dynamics.

BUSAD 801 or STAT 500 or instructor/program approval.\u00a0Students are typically expected to have completed a prior statistics course at the undergraduate or graduate level. The course will provide you with an in-depth look at how to: A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment. Grading of class projects and exams involves a scoring rubric and comparison to products/exams of other students in the class. Each student should consider that s/he is starting the course with a mean (average) grade. Student work will either lower or raise this grade. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments. Student work will be graded as: The grade-point equivalents for +/- marks are A- (3.67), B+ (3.33), B- (2.67), and C+(2.33). *Grades will be based on the following scale: A = 93-100, A- = 90-92.99, B+ = 87-89.99, B =83 -86.99, B- = 80-82.99, C+ = 77-79.99, C = 70-76.99, D = 60-69.99, and F = Below 60 There are 14 weekly discussion forums in this course. Students will be evaluated based on their timely and meaningful responses to forum questions. At a minimum, each student is expected to post one direct response to the prompt and one response to other students\u2019 postings for each forum question. Quality of interaction is always valued over quantity. In addition, students are highly encouraged to share references to additional and relevant resources with the rest of the class via posting to the appropriate forum. Weekly class discussions will be evaluated using two criteria on a 5-point scale (10 points total). The 12 discussions with the highest grades will be used in the final calculation for class participation. The goal of the assigned exercises is the understanding, based on hands-on experience, of the translation of managerial questions into research questions answerable through data analysis. Several walk-throughs of the exercises, including sample queries, are provided in the lessons for the class. Each student will prepare a summary report of the exercises they completed; a minimum of two completed exercises is required. If a third exercise is completed, we will count the two highest grades earned for this assignment. Working in teams of 2-4 students throughout the semester, students will complete online activities designed to reflect and extend the reading assignments and class notes. These team activities and their corresponding team discussions span more than one week/lesson. Hence, team reports may entail more than one part as the team works through an activity. A total of three (3) team reports are assigned. Working within their team, students will decide on an HRM area of interest and will select a decision that managers typically must make in that area. Students will 1) develop a model for the focal HR process or problem, 2) develop an analytics model that describes at least one of the decision processes, 3) list the data and data characteristics required for a decision, 4) describe the process used to get and organize the data and the analytical techniques and tools that would be used to reach an outcome or decision, and 5) describe the anticipated deployment and life cycle management of the model. Students may use available databases and other resources to demonstrate the feasibility of their approach and anticipated outcomes, but actual data collection, determination of an outcome, and validation is not required. Students will present and discuss their projects in a forum during the last week of class. At the end of the semester, each student will be asked to rate and comment on the individual contributions of team members, including themselves throughout the course. A form for this evaluation is provided. The individual grade on this assignment will reflect the overall ratings provided by the members of each team as well as the instructor\u2019s evaluation of the quality and completeness of the submitted peer review form. *subject to change Let\u2019s look more deeply at the three types of analytics and the pertinent questions that are posed to gather the correct data. Descriptive Analytics:\u00a0In the exploration of data analytics, we find the foundational layer of Descriptive Analytics. The quintessential question associated with this layer is:\u00a0\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0This can be analogized to the story beginning with,\u00a0\u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d\u00a0Within this framework, descriptive\u00a0analytics describes and frames what happened in the past by analyzing and visualizing data from an event or\u00a0phenomena that has already occurred. Predictive Analytics:\u00a0 At the core, predictive analytics endeavors to forecast impending events by gauging probabilities and discerning emergent trends.\u00a0 The question associated with this layer is:\u00a0\u201cWhat will happen next?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This can be analogized to the story beginning with\u00a0\u201cChanges are\u2026.\u201d\u00a0Such forecasts are predicated upon the relationships discerned within the data and models germinated from our earlier understanding via descriptive analytics, incorporating tools such as regression analysis and machine learning. In essence, predictive analytics embodies the art and science of prognostication, grounded in rigorous statistical evaluation of historical, contemporary, and prospective data trajectories. Prescriptive Analytics:\u00a0Prescriptive analytics endeavors to prescribe what should happen, or what is the best course of action given what\u00a0we know from the data.\u00a0 Also, what we perceive to be constraints and opportunities, not as widely used as\u00a0machine learning. The question associated with this layer is\u00a0\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u00a0This can be analogized to the story beginning with,\u00a0\u201cThe best thing to do\u2026\u201d\u00a0It not only informs but also counsels on the optimal path forward, taking into account our amassed data knowledge, and the constraints and opportunities that lie ahead. Several articles are included as course resources to describe the legal and ethical issues\u00a0and guidelines re: privacy laws, risk management, and people data protection. Calculating Employee Lifetime Value involves considering various elements such as the employee\u2019s productivity, contributions to projects, potential for innovation, and their impact on team dynamics.

By focusing on predictive analytics, workforce planning, and metrics like Employee Lifetime Value (ELV) and retention modeling, this course prepares graduates to make strategic decisions that align with business objectives. Students learn to integrate statistical tools, ethical considerations, and strategic insights, enabling them to influence organizational culture, enhance productivity, and drive innovation. Careers in people analytics are highly sought after in today\u2019s data-driven business landscape. Graduates of BUSAD 843 can pursue roles such as People Analytics Specialist, Workforce Planning Analyst, HR Data Scientist, and Talent Management Consultant. These positions are prevalent across industries, from tech giants optimizing employee engagement to consulting firms designing data-driven HR strategies. The ability to analyze people data effectively positions professionals to lead transformative initiatives, making them valuable assets in a competitive job market. One real-world example of a people analytics application can be seen in a large retail organization experiencing high employee turnover, particularly in its customer service department. The organization noticed that turnover rates were affecting customer satisfaction, as new employees required significant time and resources for training. Managers suspected that low engagement and limited career advancement opportunities were contributing to the issue, but they lacked data to confirm their assumptions or guide actionable solutions. To address this, a People Analytics Specialist trained in BUSAD 843 was brought in to analyze the problem. Using a combination of employee engagement surveys, historical attrition data, and performance metrics, the specialist built a predictive model to identify patterns and key drivers of turnover. The analysis revealed that employees with unclear career development paths and inconsistent feedback from managers were significantly more likely to leave within their first year. Armed with these insights, the specialist proposed several targeted interventions, including mentorship programs, structured performance reviews, and clear advancement pathways. They also developed dashboards to monitor engagement and turnover metrics in real-time. Within a year of implementing these changes, the organization saw a marked decrease in turnover rates and a corresponding improvement in customer satisfaction scores. This example highlights the transformative impact of applying people analytics to solve complex workforce challenges, demonstrating the value of the skills developed in BUSAD 843. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 14: Team Project Presentations Unlocking Your Potential Three Types of Analytics Examples of the kinds of questions that ELV calculations can help to answer:Home EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsDescribe, model, and evaluate human resource processes such as recruitment, selection,\u00a0compensation, performance evaluation, productivity management and enhancement, training,\u00a0development, safety protocols, and occupational health\u00a0\u200b Demonstrate understanding of the various sources of unstructured and structured data you\u00a0may encounter in business settings\u200b Demonstrate the ability to apply traditional predictive analytics techniques, such as linear and\u00a0multiple regression and various forecasting methods, to identify trends in data and future\u00a0staffing and performance requirements\u200b Recognize the relative strengths and limitations as well as common errors and biases associated\u00a0with using certain tools and approaches to analyzing data\u200b Develop queries, analyze data, and generate reports that meaningfully and ethically \u201ctell a\u00a0story\u201d that is appropriately tailored to those who need and can use the information\u200b Apply frameworks and metrics that link people data with business outcomes, strategic\u00a0initiatives, and diversity, equity, and inclusion goalsWest, M.

One example of a real-world project suited for a software engineering graduate with capstone experience is in the healthcare sector, where a hospital sought to develop a telemedicine platform for virtual consultations. The initial platform struggled with HIPAA compliance and offered a complex user interface, resulting in low adoption rates by both patients and providers. To address these issues, a software engineer with a capstone background in user-centered design and secure system development was brought in. Through stakeholder consultations, they redefined the platform\u2019s requirements, emphasizing data security and usability. By implementing robust encryption protocols and simplifying the interface, the engineer created a secure, user-friendly platform that met regulatory standards, significantly increased adoption, and ultimately improved access to virtual healthcare services. Another impactful example is in the financial technology industry, where a bank aimed to deploy a real-time fraud detection tool to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. The initial system failed to process data efficiently, causing delays that allowed some fraudulent transactions to go undetected. A software engineering graduate with capstone experience in machine learning and scalable system architecture was recruited to revamp the tool. They worked closely with data scientists to design a machine learning algorithm capable of processing transactions in real time and identifying suspicious activity patterns. With this enhanced fraud detection system, the bank effectively reduced fraudulent activity, protected client assets, and improved trust, showcasing the value of hands-on capstone experience in designing responsive, data-driven solutions. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Finalize and Showcase Your Product in Sprint 4 Unlocking Your PotentialHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticscreate a concept of operations, write effective progress reports on a software development progress, select appropriate platforms and technologies to meet project needs, develop a software architecture using best practices (communicate analysis and design, use architecture styles and design patterns, elaborate different architecture views), use best practices for project management (e.,g. continuous delivery), software development (e.g., SCRUM, DevOps) and improved product quality (e.g. software testing), use automated testing tools, and develop a significant software product from scratch.Software Requirements Specifications Software Architecture & Design Documentation Software Testing Report Software End-User ManualProject Conception Software Requirements & Architecture Product Development: The Bones, The Organs, The Brains, The FleshSoftware Requirements Capstone Experience Product Developmentcreate a concept of operations write effective progress reports on a software development progress select appropriate platforms and technologies to meet project needs develop a software architecture using best practices (communicate analysis and design, use architecture styles and design patterns, elaborate different architecture views) use best practices for project management (e.g. continuous delivery), software development (e.g., SCRUM, DevOps) and improved product quality (e.g. software testing) use automated testing tools develop a significant software product from scratchL1 L2 L3-5 L6-8 L9-11 L12-14Introduction Forum: Connect with classmates in the discussion forum to exchange ideas and introduce your project concept.

Varies and changes to maintain relevancy. *subject to change During the ideation and prototyping phases product concepts are tested to identify features and versions that are likely to be successful in the marketplace. Concept tests typically involve asking consumers survey questions about their perceptions of the offering and its characteristics\u2013including assessing aspects such as usefulness, liking, and purchase intent. Conjoint analysis is a research tool that is often employed for this purpose. It relies on a research methodology using survey questions to identify combinations of product/service elements leading to the greatest market receptivity. Respondents are presented with a variety of product packages, each with different versions of features, and are asked to select those they\u2019re most interested in. Back-end analytics then identify the features that produce the strongest positive responses, thereby helping marketers to identify the right combination of product characteristics The goal of marketing is to move customers through the purchase journey and beyond to loyalty. The customer lifecycle framework postulates that this process has six phases. It begins when customers discover the brand and its offerings and is ongoing as brands maintain relationships with customers via engagement that keeps them coming back. Let\u2019s talk about each phase specifically, and review some analytics you may apply to generate insights for each area. Kano analysis (named after the individual who created the model) is a technique for identifying the features of an offering that are likely to be most successfully received by customers. The model identifies the most relevant and important features of an offering by how well they perform on 2 dimensions. The Kano model assumes that customers have three types of needs. There are varying terminologies associated with these 3 groups so if you see different verbiage be aware they\u2019re all getting at the same concepts: These are features that customers expect from a product (sometimes called \u2018cost of entry\u2019 because they are essentially required by an offering in their market). For example, texting ability is a feature the majority (if not all) customers expect from a cell phone; therefore, a cell phone producer must include that feature to meet this expected need. In Kano analysis, these needs are sometimes referred to as \u2018must be\u2019 because without them customers would not consider the offering. These features don\u2019t create excitement or delight but can lead to customer dissatisfaction if not done well. These features are the next step up from expected needs\u2013the ones that customers want from an offering. They\u2019re also the features of an offering that differentiate it in the marketplace. To continue with my example, texting functionality is an expected feature for a cell phone but a high-megapixel camera is likely to be a differentiating feature for a cell phone. In Kano analysis, these types of features are called \u2018satisfiers\u2019 because when done well they increase customer satisfaction. These are features of an offering that set it far apart from competitors. These features meet needs customers may not even know they have, and when included they elicit feelings of delight (which is why Kano analysis often refers to them as \u2018delighters\u2019). Customers don\u2019t expect these features, but when they are included they can greatly increase satisfaction. For example, an AI technology feature in a cell phone may meet this criterion.

Financial Statements & Ratios Time Value of Money Borrowing, Lending, Investing & Establishing Planning Horizon Present, Future, and Annual Worth Analysis Rate of Return & Depreciation Capital Budgeting Replacement Analysis & Inflation Effects *subject to change Cash flow\u00a0is the movement of money that flows in and out of a system and the\u00a0cash flow diagram\u00a0is the pictorial depiction of the movement. Money flowing out is normally considered as\u00a0negative\u00a0and money coming in is considered as\u00a0positive\u00a0cash flow. The cash flow diagram will look opposite if we draw the diagram from the borrower or lender\u2019s point of view. It is easier to solve the problem, if we actually see the cash flow. An\u00a0outflow\u00a0or an investment of $1000 at the beginning of year 1 (at the end of year 0) and an\u00a0inflow\u00a0or return of $2000 at the end of year 5 is shown by the following Cash Flow Diagram (CFD). The initial expenditure of $4000, followed by the receipt of $5000, followed by an expenditure of $3000, followed by a second receipt of $5000, followed by a final expenditure of $2000, followed by a final receipt of $5000 can be shown as below. In a single investment option the main concern is how much money I will have at the end of the planning horizon, or if I need to have X dollars at what interest rate I should invest. Cells K4 thru K12 contain the cash flow sequence for end of year 10 thru 18. Cell L4 thru L12 contain the future value of the cash flow. Thus $1000*(1+5%)^(18-10) = $1477.46 and so on. The sum is $15,985.04 and it is the future value of the cash flow. This is the amount of money that will be available for college. Next, we should calculate the uniform amount that needs to be deposited each year to get the same future value. To accomplish this we could use the payment function available in Excel: =PMT(5%,9,,-15985.04) =$1,449.68. If a uniform deposit of $1,449.68 was made for 9 years, the same amount will be realized at the end of the planning horizon. We can also use in combination with\u00a0Goal Seek\u00a0to get this value. We will start with $1,000 per year and calculate the future value. Then we use Goal Seek to get the correct amount. The formulas in the Excel spreadsheet area are shown below for further clarification. If we want to find the uniform deposit for 18 years to obtain the same future value of $15,985.04, this can be easily accomplished using the PMT function =PMT(5%,18,,-15985.04) =$568.21. Let us look at a problem where a decision has to be made between Vendor A and Vendor B. Vendor A costs $380,000 and an increase in revenue of $125,000. Vendor B costs $280,000 and an increase in revenue of $95,000. The planning horizon is 4 years and MARR is 10%. The Excel spreadsheet calculates the future values of Vendor A and Vendor B. The net Cash flow is the sum of the positive and negative cash flows. With cash flow and MARR, the future worth can be calculated. Thus $125,000*(1+10%)^(4-1) = $166,375.00, which is given in cell M6. The future worth of Vendor B is greater than Vendor A and the decision is based on the highest FW. Thus Vendor B should be preferred. We can also use the incremental analysis to obtain the future worth. However, the results will be the same as the ranking method based on FW Cash Flow Statement indicates how much revenue, from any sources, the company has taken in over a given time. It is a good gauge of how liquid the company is and how effectively they manage their cash flow. It describes how money moves in and out of the business and is a quick window for deciding whether the company will be able to pay their bills and how liquid they really are. From this you can see how able the company will be to generate cash. This statement deals only with cash and cash equivalents. This include cash on hand, short-term investments that are less than 3 months, bank accounts and demand deposits. Only highly liquid investments are considered. The International Accounting Standard (IAS 7) requires reporting of these changes in cash and cash equivalents. It is portioned into three main categories, namely cash flow from operations, cash flow from investment, and cash flow from financing. Money coming in is called\u00a0cash inflow\u00a0and cash going out of the business is called\u00a0cash outflow\u00a0with positive and negative signs, respectively. Operating Activities: Operating activities refers to the ability of a company to generate cash, based on its own revenue generating activities as opposed to financing or investing. Operating activities include production, sales and delivery of products or services. Examples of operating activities include: cash from sale of goods or services, royalty fees, commissions, and other revenue such as cash payments to suppliers for material or service, cash for insurance premium, annuities and other policy benefits, and cash payment to employees. The Apple Inc. cash flow statements are grouped under depreciation, adjustments to net income, changes in accounts receivables, changes in liabilities, changes in inventories and changes in other operating activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from operating activities for Apple is $65.82 billion dollars. This is cash inflow \u2013 cash coming into the business. Investing Activities: Investing activities are acquisition and disposal of property, land, equipment and other long term assets. It deals with the cash payment. These also includes loans made to suppliers or received from the customers. For Apple Inc., they are grouped under Capital Expenditures, Investments and other cash flows from investing activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from investing activities for Apple is -$45.98 billion dollars. This is cash outflow \u2013 cash going out of the business. Financing Activities: Financing activities include cash inflows from investors, banks and shareholders as well as the cash outflow to the shareholders as dividends. Examples include: dividend payments; repurchasing company shares; capital loses and repayment of debt. For Apple Inc., they are grouped under Dividends paid, Purchase of stocks, Net borrowing and other cash flows from financing activities. For the year ending September 2016, the total cash flow from financing activities for Apple is -$20.48 billion dollars. This is cash outflow \u2013 cash going out from the business. Thus, the total cash inflow from operating activities for Apple is $65.82 billion dollars and the cash outflow from investing activities for Apple is -$45.98 billion dollars and the cash outflow from financing activities is -$20.48 billion dollars. In other words, $65.82 billion dollars came into the system and $66.46 billion dollars went out of the system. The change in the cash flow for the year 2016 is a negative $0.66 billion dollars. During the year 2015 the change in the cash flow was positive $7.28 billion. This is due to the fact there was more than a 15 billion cash inflow from the operating activities due to change in liabilities. Debt consolidation, refinancing and other changes in liabilities provide significant cash flow into the system.

The course covers essential concepts such as marginal analysis, present value analysis, supply and demand, agency theory, and game theory. By using these frameworks, students will develop critical decision-making skills, enabling them to address real-world challenges like pricing strategies, employee management, and maximizing profitability. This course also provides foundational knowledge beneficial to other MBA courses, particularly in finance, marketing, and business strategy, ensuring students are equipped for effective management in various organizational contexts. Managers make many economic decisions every day. How many employees should be hired, how they should be monitored, what price should be charged for the firm\u2019s product to reach firm objectives, how to maximize profitability, and so on are some of the questions managers deal with every day. Managerial Economics is concerned with the application of economic principles and methodologies to key management decisions within organizations. It provides principles to foster the goals of the organization, as well as a better understanding of the external business environment in which an organization operates. Managerial Economics is fundamentally a unique way of thinking about problems, issues and decisions that managers face at the functional as well as the strategic levels, and this course provides students with theoretical concepts and frameworks such as marginal analysis, present value analysis, supply and demand, agency theory, game theory, and so on and help them develop rational decision-making skills. A primary purpose of the course is to develop tools useful in other MBA courses since economics is the foundation for much of what is taught in finance, marketing, business strategy and many other courses in the MBA program.

Degree Programs Bulletin:\u00a0http://www.psu.edu/bulletins/whitebook/$acadinfo.ht) The course is taught 75% online using a variety of methods including: lecture, small and large group discussions, discussion boards, case studies, problem sets, practice problems, and actively preparing for class by reading assigned text chapters and watching lectures. Students are encouraged to respectfully challenge their own, each others, and the instructor\u2019s views.\u00a0 The classroom is a cooperative learning environment where students are encouraged to help each other learn the course materials. The fact that classes are scheduled is evidence that the faculty believes class instruction is important. Therefore, class attendance is important for the benefit of students. Accordingly, it is the policy of the University that class attendance by students be encouraged and that all instructors organize and conduct their courses with this policy in mind. A student should attend every class for which the student is scheduled and should be held responsible for all work covered in the courses taken. In each case, the instructor should decide when the class absence constitutes a danger to the student\u2019s scholastic attainment and should make this fact known to the student at once. A student whose irregularity in attendance causes the student, in the judgment of the instructor, to become deficient scholastically may run the risk of receiving a failing grade or receiving a lower grade than the student might have secured had the student been in regular attendance.

The low price charged by the incumbent did not prevent entry; the entrant stayed out because it believed the incumbent would produce at least Q_L, if it entered. A revised strategy is to set the monopoly price, P^M, and produce the monopoly output, Q^M, and threaten to expand output to Q^L, if entry occurs.\n\nThis, however, is not a credible threat; so, a rational entrant would find it profitable to enter if the incumbent sets price, P^L.

One real-world example of a project undertaken by a student with knowledge from BUSAD 811: New Ventures Ideation and Feasibility Analysis can be observed in the food and beverage industry. A group of students identified a growing consumer interest in sustainable and ethically sourced coffee. Recognizing a market opportunity, they proposed the creation of a coffee shop that not only served high-quality, ethically sourced coffee but also operated on zero-waste principles. The project began with a thorough market analysis to understand consumer preferences, competitive offerings, and potential locations. The students used their training from BUSAD 811 to construct detailed business models, including revenue streams from selling specialty coffee, related merchandise, and hosting community events focused on sustainability education. However, they faced challenges such as higher sourcing costs for ethically produced coffee and difficulties in implementing a zero-waste system in a high-volume setting. To address these issues, the students conducted multiple feasibility studies and engaged with potential suppliers to secure favorable terms. They also partnered with local environmental organizations to develop effective waste reduction strategies. This approach ensured the venture aligned closely with customer values and operational realities, making the coffee shop a popular destination. The successful launch and operation of the coffee shop demonstrated the practical application of new venture ideation and feasibility analysis, leading to a business that was both profitable and socially responsible. This example highlights how BUSAD 811 equips students with the skills to ideate, analyze, and implement business ideas that meet market needs and create meaningful impact. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Funding a Startup Adventure Unlocking Your Potential Required Textbook Solo Entrepreneurship OverviewHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsIntellige processum decisionis et identifica factores qui ad processum conferunt in contextu scientiarum decisionum ingeniariae.

Here\u2019s how to create BOTs: Building a Causal\u00a0Loop Diagram \u201cA short-term symptomatic \u201csolution\u201d is used to correct a problem, with seemingly positive immediate results. As this correction is used more and more, more fundamental long-term corrective measures are used less and less. Over time, the capabilities for the fundamental solution may atrophy or become disabled, leading to even greater reliance on the symptomatic solution.\u201d [Senge] Figure 6.3\u00a0shows an example of Shifting the Burden: When constructing CLDs we don\u2019t really care what about the nature of the variable \u2013 how or if it can be measured, what units it might have, the scale of those units, or the concrete relationship between two linked variables (for example, what mechanism connects a players anxiety level regarding their beer deliveries to their ordering strategy?) What we care about is documenting the critical variables and the direction each moves in relation to one another (same or opposite) so that we can determine the type of loop structures created (reinforcing or balancing). In order to simulate the model, however, we need to define the nature of the variables, their units, scales, and how they affect each other. The first step is to determine which variables are stocks and which are flows. The easiest way to think of stocks and flows is with a bathtub analogy shown in Figure 7.2. The level of water in the bathtub is the stock and would be measured in liters or gallons, say. The only way the level of water in the bathtub can increase is if the faucet was turned on and water flowed into the tub. That flow would be measured in liters/minute or gallons/minute. Equally, the only way the level of water would decrease is if the plug was removed from the drain and water flowed out of the tub. Again, this flow would be measured in l/min or gpm. Without a flow (the faucet or drain) the stock (the level of water) cannot change. This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week. In this lesson, you\u2019ll dive into the fundamentals of systems thinking, learning how to view problems and solutions as interconnected parts of a larger whole. This approach equips you to navigate complex projects with clarity and confidence. By the end of these lessons, you will be equipped with the skills and mindset to approach complex challenges with a systems-oriented perspective, enhancing your problem-solving abilities and project outcomes. This lesson introduces you to the foundational concepts of system modeling, focusing on how structures within systems influence their behavior. Through engaging activities, you\u2019ll learn to represent systems visually to better understand their dynamics. By the end of this module, you\u2019ll be equipped to identify critical variables, understand their relationships, and construct diagrams that reveal the deeper structures behind system behaviors. These skills will empower you to diagnose and influence complex systems effectively. This lesson delves deeper into causal loop diagrams (CLDs), reinforcing your ability to model system behavior. You\u2019ll explore reinforcing loops, self-correcting mechanisms, and the dynamics that lead to S-shaped growth patterns. By the end, you\u2019ll understand how to represent these behaviors and their underlying structures. By completing this module, you\u2019ll master the ability to construct models of reinforcing and self-correcting behavior, identify limits to growth structures, and recognize the interplay between mental models and system dynamics. These skills will elevate your systems thinking approach and prepare you for more complex applications. This lesson focuses on how mental models shape our understanding of systems and influence our responses to problems. By exploring the interplay between perception and reality, you\u2019ll learn to recognize how individual viewpoints can affect decision-making within a system. By completing this module, you\u2019ll deepen your understanding of the impact of mental models, learn to integrate diverse perspectives into problem-solving, and apply Soft Systems Methodology to complex systems. This lesson explores how subconscious mental models shape our perception of systems and situations. You\u2019ll learn to recognize how biases influence the data we select and the assumptions we make, as well as strategies for reflecting on and challenging these biases to improve decision-making. By completing this module, you will gain the ability to evaluate subconscious influences on perception, distinguish between models of social systems, and approach complex challenges with a more reflective, systems-oriented mindset. This lesson focuses on the intersection of system dynamics and systems thinking. By understanding systemic structures, you\u2019ll uncover leverage points that can drive meaningful change in complex systems. You\u2019ll also explore how to balance varying perspectives to address wicked problems effectively. By completing this module, you\u2019ll be equipped to explain systemic structures in complex situations, identify leverage points, and apply systems thinking principles to address real-world challenges with a collaborative and informed approach. This lesson introduces the foundational concepts of stock and flow modeling, helping you understand the differences between rates (flows) and levels (stocks). You\u2019ll learn how these elements interact to create the dynamic behavior observed in complex systems. By completing this module, you\u2019ll be able to distinguish between stocks and flows, develop stock and flow models, and use policy simulators to analyze and guide decisions in complex systems. SSYEN 507 equips professionals with the critical skills needed to address complex, interconnected challenges in various industries. By mastering concepts like causal loop diagrams, stock and flow models, and system archetypes, students develop the ability to analyze systemic structures and identify leverage points for meaningful change. These skills are in high demand across sectors such as technology, healthcare, manufacturing, and government, where systems thinking is essential for designing efficient, scalable, and sustainable solutions. Graduates of this course are well-prepared for roles like Systems Engineer, Policy Analyst, Operations Manager, and Strategic Planner. Employers value candidates with the ability to approach problems holistically, model system behavior, and collaborate across disciplines to address \u201cwicked problems.\u201d Adding SYSEN507 to your resume demonstrates a strong foundation in systems thinking and quantitative modeling\u2014key qualifications for advancing in a competitive job market. A real-world example of a systems thinking challenge can be seen in urban transportation planning. A city faced growing congestion and pollution due to increasing car usage, which impacted air quality, commute times, and overall quality of life. Stakeholders included commuters, public transportation agencies, environmental advocates, businesses, and city planners, each with conflicting priorities. Commuters desired convenience and affordability, while environmental groups pushed for reduced emissions. Meanwhile, local businesses worried about the economic impact of reduced car access to shopping areas. Initial attempts to solve the problem with isolated interventions\u2014such as adding bike lanes or implementing tolls\u2014failed to address the broader systemic issues, leading to unintended consequences like increased traffic in neighboring areas and public backlash. To address this, systems engineers applied the principles of SYSENG 507 by creating a holistic system dynamics model. Using causal loop diagrams (CLDs), they mapped the relationships between variables like public transit availability, road usage, air pollution, and economic activity. They then transitioned to stock and flow models to simulate the long-term impact of various policy decisions, such as expanding public transit, implementing congestion pricing, and incentivizing electric vehicle usage. Stakeholders were engaged throughout the process to ensure their perspectives were represented in the model. The resulting policy simulation revealed that a combination of public transit expansion and congestion pricing could reduce traffic while maintaining economic activity. This approach allowed the city to implement targeted policies with broad stakeholder support, ultimately reducing congestion, lowering emissions, and improving the quality of life for residents. This example highlights the critical role of systems thinking and quantitative modeling in addressing complex, interconnected challenges, demonstrating the real-world value of skills learned in SYSENG 507. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: System Archetypes: Recurring Patterns of Behavior Unlocking Your Potential Stocks and FlowsHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsUnderstand the evolution of information systems architecture in organizations.

Readings are assigned every week. These readings will include selections from the required texts, as well as other sources (e.g., articles, scholarly papers, etc.). All readings are required (unless noted as optional) and contain material that will be covered on the exams. You may be asked to participate in online discussion forums based on these readings as part of your graded coursework; see Assignments and Activities below. There will be\u00a0one (1) course project\u00a0assigned in this course that focuses on the redesign of an existing product. It is an\u00a0individual\u00a0project, although you may discuss it with your classmates as you work on it. The purpose of this project\u00a0is to help you synthesize, integrate, and apply the material covered in class and from the readings. Full project details will be provided separately. Various assignments and activities will be available or assigned throughout the course. Some will be graded (e.g., discussion forums), while others \u2013 although not graded \u2013 are still recommended to supplement your learning (e.g., \u201ctest your knowledge\u201d quizzes). The typical turnaround time for assignments will be seven (7) days after assignments are submitted. Within 7 days after you have submitted an assignment, you will be able to review your grade and any comments made by your instructor. This process is used for all homework assignments, exams, or other graded submissions. Some instructors may also send you a message informing you that the assignment has been graded. Some instructors may choose to release all the grades to all students at once; other instructors may release grades per student one at a time. *Subject to change While invention and design have always been with us in some form, patents are relatively new in the span of human history. In this section, you will learn some basic facts about the \u201cinvention\u201d of patents and the legal systems created around them. You will also learn how to distinguish among the basic types of intellectual property protection commonly used today \u2013 i.e., copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents \u2013 with a chance to test your knowledge at the end of the section. In learning about patents, you will be introduced to the three kinds of patents found in the U.S.\u00a0patent system, along with the five statutory classes of subject matter considered patentable and the three essential qualities every patentable\u00a0invention must meet. (SELECT TITLES\u00a0TO LEARN MORE) The history of invention is both extensive and fascinating, full of many interesting anecdotes and amazing advancements; we could spend an entire course on the historical background of invention alone. For our purposes here, we will satisfy ourselves with just a few key facts that will set the stage for understanding how inventions are protected in the United States. We begin in the 15th century, when the practice of granting exclusive rights to an inventor for a limited time first occurred (as far as we know). The first patent law was established in Venice, Italy, in 1474, where it was utilized by Galileo for an irrigation pump. Other European nations also granted patents in a similar way; the practice was a way for a ruler to reward his (occasionally her) friends for political and/or financial favors. The British Parliament curtailed these abuses in 1624 and defined specific conditions for granting patents to inventors (i.e., the owner and duration of the patent). Like so many of our regulatory mechanisms, the U.S.\u00a0patent system was inspired by the British patent system, although no general patent law appeared in the U.S.. until 1790. Prior to the adoption of the U.S.\u00a0Constitution, individual colonies granted patents. Then, within its structure, the authors of the U.S. Constitution placed a clause that granted Congress the authority to establish a patent system, although they did not specifically use that term: U.S.\u00a0Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 8:\u00a0\u201cThe Congress shall have the power\u00a0to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries.\u201d Generally speaking, the original purpose and philosophy of the U.S.\u00a0patent system was to provide a stimulus to industry and to support the development of a budding nation. The subject matter covered by that system was stated to be \u201cany useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement thereon not before known or used\u201d. Moreover, applicants who were interested in applying for a patent were to provide a patent specification and drawing, and if possible, a working model. Figure 1.1. shows a patent granted to Samuel Hopkins of Philadelphia, PA on July 31, 1790. Mr. Hopkins received the first U.S. patent on record\u00a0for his improvement in \u201cthe making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new Apparatus and Process\u201d. Protecting one\u2019s intellectual property is a bit of a paradoxical challenge: How can a person openly put an idea to use and still retain exclusive rights to the idea? In the United States, intellectual property laws were designed to protect the rights arising from the creative mental work of individuals. Intellectual property refers to products of the mind, which can be protected by the following mechanisms: (SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE) Copyrights: Copyrights protect an author\u2019s creative works (e.g., literary, musical, dramatic, pictorial, movies, computer programs, etc.) from unauthorized copying. It\u2019s important to note that copyrights protect\u00a0the manner of expression of an idea, not the underlying idea itself. So, for example, two different people can write books about the life of Henry Ford, but they cannot use the same collection of words and artwork in the same arrangement. Here are a few other things you should know concerning copyrights: Trademarks: Trademarks are distinctive words, phrases, names, symbols, or devices used to identify the source of goods in commerce. A trademark\u00a0is not used to identify the product itself \u2013 only the\u00a0source\u00a0of the product. So, for example, anyone can manufacture and sell soft drinks (using their own recipe), but only the Coca-Cola\u00ae\u00a0company can put their trademark on a bottle or can. Moreover, trademarks remain in force indefinitely (with renewal every 20 years), provided the mark has not been retired. To register your trademark, you must apply to the U.S.\u00a0Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which is located in Alexandria, Virginia. Trade Secrets: Trade Secrets are confidential information held by industry that are protected under the body of common law (\u201ctrade secret law\u201d) governed by the individual states. More importantly, there is no universal agreement on what constitutes a trade secret. Some general examples would be processes, formulas, patterns, devices, or customer lists \u2013 anything that gives a company a competitive advantage over another. Patents: Now we come to the \u201cmain meal\u201d of this lesson: understanding\u00a0patents. Our\u00a0key resource\u00a0for information on patents will be\u00a0the U.S.. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Make yourself familiar with the USPTO web site:\u00a0www.uspto.gov. It\u00a0is an excellent resource for learning about intellectual property, even if you never intend to file for a patent or trademark yourself \u2013 and you will use it in completing your course project as well! A U.S.. patent is granted by the Federal government to an inventor, giving her/him the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling her/his invention in the U.S.\u00a0for a limited period of time. The key here is the word \u201cexclude\u201d: a patent does not give a person the right to use/sell/practice his or her invention, only to\u00a0exclude others\u00a0from doing so. In terms of timeframe, a patent is granted for a period of time that begins on the date of issue and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. Patent applications come not only from individuals, but also from teams and corporations. In fact, only around 15% of U.S.\u00a0patent applications currently come from independent inventors. This can be attributed to changes in the technical problem solving environment (including the cost of patent applications) and the importance of teams in invention. Three Types of Patents There are three types of patentable inventions, leading to\u00a0three types of patents:\u00a0utility patents,\u00a0design patents, and\u00a0plant patents. The tabbed sections below describe these types and provide examples. In addition to the USPTO web site, you can also search for all three types of patents using the Google patent search web site:\u00a0patents.google.com. (SELECT ARROWS TO LEARN MORE) Utility Patents As you might expect, utility patents protect \u201cinventions of utility\u201d, where the emphasis is on the functionality of the invention (what does it\u00a0do). This is the most common type of patent, making up 90% of those granted by the USPTO. An example of a device covered by a utility patent would be a security document with specially encoded data (U.S. Patent #6,546,112 B1)\u00a0or a machine to produce stamped cookie cutters. Design Patents With design patents, the emphasis is on the appearance or aesthetic properties of the invention, rather than its functionality. This is the second most common type of patent granted by the USPTO. An example of an invention covered by a design patent would be a chair supported by a unique type of pedestal rather than four legs\u00a0or a powder compact for make-up (U.S. Design Patent #D407,853). Plant Patents Finally, certain types of plants are covered by plant patents \u2013 specifically, plants that are reproduced asexually (i.e., reproduced by means other than from seeds, cuttings, tuber propagation, or grafting). This is the least common type of patent and would cover (for example) specially bred roses or peach trees (U.S. Plant Patent\u00a0#PP10,872). Five Classes of Subject Matter Furthermore,\u00a0a patentable invention must meet several specific requirements: (1) it must be of a\u00a0suitable subject matter, and (2) it must exhibit three essential qualities.\u00a0When it comes to utility patents, there are\u00a0five statutory classes of subject matter\u00a0considered patentable, as follows: Three Essential Qualities In addition, patentable inventions must exhibit\u00a0three\u00a0essential qualities:\u00a0Novelty,\u00a0Utility, and\u00a0Non-Obviousness. Novelty:\u00a0To meet the novelty criterion, an invention must not be published or patented anywhere in the world or used/sold in the U.S. more than one year prior to the date of application for a patent. In essence, then, proving novelty means you must show that your idea is sufficiently different from those that came before it.\u00a0This is done by showing that the product has not appeared in any previously published literature or public distribution setting; demonstrating this is known as searching the\u00a0prior art. Utility:\u00a0To meet the utility requirement, the invention must be useful (serve a useful purpose or function), even if its only function or use is amusement. The assessment of utility is definitely subjective; some patent functions can seem downright silly, like an electronic snore depressor (U.S. Patent #3,480,010A). Non-Obviousness:\u00a0To meet the non-obviousness criterion, an invention must not be obvious to people with ordinary skill in the domain of the invention. The assessment here is a bit abstract and subjective, and definitely requires a technical background and familiarity with the prior art. For example, minor changes in material or form are not patentable due to their obviousness. Non-Patentable Things Based on the\u00a0three essential qualities described above, the USPTO has identified several categories of things that\u00a0cannot\u00a0be patented. Table 1.3 shows examples of\u00a0things that are not patentable, along with the relevant reasons. A Few More Patent Facts In general, patent systems fall into two categories:\u00a0first-to-invent\u00a0and\u00a0first-to-file. In\u00a0first-to-invent\u00a0systems, the first person to invent or \u201creduce a device to practice\u201d has precedence over anyone else filing a patent application for the same device. In such a system, it is the responsibility of the inventor to prove that he/she created an invention before anyone else \u2013 a good reason to keep\u00a0detailed and dated invention notebooks!\u00a0In\u00a0first-to-file\u00a0systems, the first person to file a patent application for a particular device has precedence. Until 2013, the U.S.\u00a0patent system was a\u00a0first-to-invent system. The \u201cAmerica Invents Act\u201d, signed by President Barack Obama on September 16, 2011, switched\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0patent system\u00a0from a first-to-invent\u00a0system\u00a0to a first-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. In your second reading for this week \u2013 Petroski, Ch. 5 (Aluminum Cans and Failure) \u2013 you will consider the different kinds of failure that occur in design and invention, and how they influence the resultant emerging patterns of solution development. Many kinds of failure are relevant in our engineering practice, including technical and conceptual failure, among others. (SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE) Technical Failure: Technical failure is the fundamental failure (technological breakdown or malfunction) of a material, device, process, or program. Technical failures can be unintended, leading to an unplanned loss of function in a design or invention (e.g., the collapse of a beam under a heavy load; a programming error). Such unintended technical failures are destructive; we manage these known sources of potential failure within the design process through various mechanisms, including safety factors and scheduled maintenance checks. Interestingly, technical failures can also be purposeful \u2013 i.e., they can actually be\u00a0designed\u00a0into\u00a0a product or system as part of its intended technical functionality, such as the physical separation of the metal tab on an aluminum can or the perforated section of a packaging envelope. We might even call this \u201cfailure by design\u201d. Conceptual Failure: Conceptual failure is the failure of a concept or idea to deliver the desired or promised results, even when the concept is realized perfectly (i.e., an idea doesn\u2019t work out the way we thought it would and/or factors or implementation issues are overlooked). An example would be a new auto body design that promises to be more aerodynamic than a previous model, but upon testing, we find that it is not. Or we may believe that a new toothpaste container will be a huge success in the market, only to find that customers don\u2019t like it once we put it on the grocery store shelves. Or the environmental side effects of a product make it impossible to support, even though it is a technical success. In closing this section \u2013 and this lesson \u2013 it is important to consider how failures of any kind impact your own design or invention work. In addition to the obvious technical need to correct any failures that lead to negative consequences, it is also important to consider our psychological and emotional responses to failure in general. If we examine the lives of famous designers and inventors, including Thomas Edison (who once stated: \u201cI have not failed. I have found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work\u201d), Stephanie Kwolek (inventor of Kevlar), Gordon Murray, and Kenneth Grange, we see that these individuals experienced failure (both technical and conceptual) as much as any other designer/inventor \u2013 possibly more so, if Edison\u2019s quote is any indication. We (and they) might say that their\u00a0success\u00a0was at least partly a result of their response to those failures: i.e., rather than giving up, they examined their failures closely and then \u201cgot back on the horse\u201d, revising their concepts and designs and trying again. As a final bit of humorous inspiration to help you persist in the face of failure, check out this brief video (\u201cThe Roses of Success\u201d) from the famous MGM film, \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d. In it, the kidnaped father of an inventor has been asked to invent a car that will float; his comrades remind\u00a0him that \u201cfrom the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success\u201d. Enjoy! In Lesson 5, you were introduced to different research methods for studying individual designers and inventors, including historical studies and\u00a0in situ\u00a0protocol studies. You might now ask yourself: do these same methods apply to studying design teams as well? The answer is \u2018yes\u2019, and you will soon see several examples from different sources, including your textbook (Cross) and the review of a recent design research study taken from the scholarly literature. (SELECT TITLES\u00a0TO LEARN MORE) In Chapter 5 of your textbook (Cross), you observed\u00a0a lone, highly experienced designer\u00a0(Victor Scheinman) applying his expert knowledge to the design of a bike rack in a think-aloud protocol study. In the first part of this week\u2019s readings (Cross, Chapter 6), you will observe\u00a0a team of three experienced designers\u00a0attacking exactly the same design problem (i.e., designing a new bike rack) \u2013 but in this case, rather than a think-aloud experiment, all of the team\u2019s actions and natural conversation were recorded and analyzed closely in a variety of ways. In particular, the roles and relationships of the team members were examined, as well as their approach to planning and changing activities, gathering and sharing information, generating and adopting concepts, and avoiding and resolving conflicts. Among other results, this study confirmed that teams of designers engage in\u00a0both\u00a0a technical process and a social process, so their interactions, personal roles, and relationships cannot be ignored as they pursue their scientific solutions. Finally, in the last part of this week\u2019s readings (Cross, Chapter 7), you will explore\u00a0a comparison of these two studies\u00a0(i.e., Scheinman vs. the design team) that includes a fascinating analysis of how much time Scheinman and the team, respectively, spent in the principal phases of their design processes (clarifying the task, searching for concepts, and fixing their final concept). As you read through these chapters, reflect on your experiences in designing things \u2013 both alone and with others \u2013 and look for insights into how your experiences were similar and different from these studies. We move now to a more recent research study involving design teams. Our aims here are twofold: (1) to add depth to your experience with design team research in general; and (2) to explore a study that integrates some of the topics you have learned in this and other courses in your degree program. The research we will briefly examine grew out of a collaborative project between Penn State University and Stanford University researchers. The work was sponsored by the\u00a0National Science Foundation (NSF)\u00a0and focused on mapping the high performance design team \u201cgenome\u201d \u2013 i.e., identifying key factors that lead to design team success by exploring the relationships between individual designer characteristics, team interaction behavior, and design performance outcomes (see Figure 6.4). Several scholarly references related to this project can be found at the end of this lesson; each one is a typical example of design team research that takes a mixed methods approach (i.e., both quantitative and qualitative analyses). While you are not required to read any of these articles for this course, you may find them interesting as a supplement to your studies. Here, we\u2019ll review just a few details taken from the first of the listed references (Jablokow, et al., 2019,\u00a0ASEE), separating our review into three sections: (SELECT TABS TO LEARN MORE) Research Aims and Methods To provide some context for this brief review, all of the design teams under observation were existing teams at the time of the study. These particular teams were enrolled in an entrepreneurship program that aimed to helped design teams move their design concepts beyond prototyping and into actual practice by applying a user-centered design approach. Each team was fairly multidisciplinary (i.e., different types of engineering or science, with some business background) and contained both students and faculty members from the same mid-Western university. Each team also included a\u00a0senior\u00a0mentor, who was assigned by the program organizers to help guide the team as it worked through the entrepreneurial design process. Within this context, the underlying\u00a0research aims\u00a0for the study were focused on\u00a0making the teams more effective,\u00a0improving the assignment process for mentors, and\u00a0enhancing each team\u2019s activities throughout the design process\u00a0through a better understanding of the individual cognitive characteristics and dynamic interactions of the teams. To this end, the research team collected data from the design teams via a 1-day workshop; the flow of the workshop is shown in Figure 6.5. The workshop began with a brief background presentation about the research study; each participant also signed a consent form prior to further participation. At the end of the background presentation, each individual completed the\u00a0KAI inventory\u00a0(the same one you completed in SYSEN 550). Following these introductory activities, all design teams were presented with the same real-world design challenge focused on the development of an inexpensive water pump for a developing country and given one hour to complete their work. Team deliverables included two prototypes made of simple craft materials: (1)\u00a0a Best Fit prototype\u00a0(readily seen to meet the design specifications) and (2)\u00a0a Dark Horse prototype\u00a0(a potentially riskier solution that might not be feasible), as well as a brief presentation. The research team video-recorded each design team\u2019s interactions as they developed and presented their solutions; the KAIs were scored as they worked. Following the first design challenge, each participant completed an individual debrief document. Next, the research team described how the videos would be analyzed (i.e., via\u00a0IDN \u2013 the Interaction Dynamics Notation) and delivered a short KAI feedback session, in which each person received his/her KAI results. This presentation was followed by a second design challenge focused on addressing the social isolation experienced by some children in hospitals. Once again, two prototyped solutions (Best Fit and Dark Horse) were requested, each team\u2019s interactions and presentations were recorded, and the same debrief document was administered at the end of the experience. As a quick aside, the method for analyzing the videos involved the application of the\u00a0Interaction Dynamics Notation (IDN), which was developed at Stanford University by one of the authors of this paper (N. Sonalkar) based on cognitive semiotics and improvisational theater. Using IDN, researchers can record the interpersonal interactions of team members and map those interactions to specific IDN symbols and sequences, as shown in Figures 6.6 and 6.7. Those interaction sequences can then be analyzed using statistical techniques, data mining, and other methods. In addition to IDN sequences, this research team also analyzed the ideation utterances for each design team (i.e., number of ideas, number of unique ideas). Design team outcomes were observed and analyzed in a number of ways. The\u00a0outcome data\u00a0collected by the research team included the design prototypes of each team (Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions), individual reflections on the design experiences, and individual perceptions of both personal and team performance. See Figure 6.8 for examples taken from the debrief survey of one participant. Findings from the Study Now let\u2019s look at a few of the findings from this study (full details can be found in the referenced conference paper). (SELECT ARROWS TO LEARN MORE) Finding #1: All of the design teams showed high cognitive style diversity, with innovative style means. This finding is not surprising for a self-proclaimed \u201centrepreneurship\u201d program in which teams self-select to participate. Other studies related to KAI have shown that entrepreneurs (as a population) tend to have more innovative cognitive styles on average, although more adaptive individuals can clearly succeed as entrepreneurs as well. Interestingly, this research team also found that coping behavior was low across all of the design teams, despite their high cognitive diversity. Finding #2:The most successful design teams in this study all contained well-positioned \u201cbridgers\u201d in terms of cognitive style. In other words, the teams who exhibited the best design results (e.g., most ideas generated, most proactive in engaging with users) had at least one team member who was \u201cmid-way\u201d (approximately) between the most adaptive and most innovative members of the team. Team reflections indicate that this bridging team member often served as a moderator for the team (even when they were not the team\u2019s formal mentor). Finding #3: Variations in individual team members\u2019 perceptions of their team outcomes were unrelated to cognitive style (KAI). Here, the finding refers to how individual team members evaluated the\u00a0novelty,\u00a0usefulness, and\u00a0feasibility\u00a0of their Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions (see Figure 6.9). One might hypothesize that the more adaptive and more innovative participants in the study would rate their Best Fit and Dark Horse solutions differently in terms of these three metrics, but the results of the study show otherwise. In general, as you can see in the figure, the Best Fit solutions of all the teams were generally evaluated as less novel but more feasible and more useful than the Dark Horse solutions. Implications of the StudyThe research we have briefly reviewed here has implications for both design practitioners and engineering educators. Among other things, it shows that cognitive characteristics can be used in composing teams to enable the \u201cbridging effect\u201d within the team and to improve the mentor matching process. It also shows that design teamwork can be explicitly investigated and understood using KAI and IDN. And finally, it confirms that the awareness of team interaction patterns and cognitive styles can help design teams identify sequences and behaviors that lead to more design ideas and to better regulation of their own performance. This course aims to help students understand the key factors influencing designers and inventors, compare their problem-solving approaches, apply design thinking to redesign products, and analyze patents as technical literature. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: Throughout this course students will gain the skills to identify key factors affecting designers and inventors, compare their problem-solving methods, apply design thinking, and analyze patents, preparing them to tackle real-world challenges effectively. This lesson introduces students to the framework guiding design and invention processes. It explores key concepts such as the history of invention, the importance of patents, and their role as technical literature. By the end of this lesson, students will have a foundational understanding of the guiding framework for design and invention, including the role of patents as technical literature and their historical significance in the innovation process. This lesson focuses on the key aspects of the design and invention process, with an emphasis on revisiting the guiding framework and exploring design models. Students will learn about human-centered design, user-centered needs analysis, and how designers and inventors approach problem-solving. By the end of this lesson, students will have a deeper understanding of the design and invention process, particularly the human-centered approach to design, and how to analyze user needs to inform problem-solving. This lesson delves into the latter stages of the design and invention process, covering ideation, prototyping, user testing, and the development phase. Students will also explore the critical role of failure in the iterative process of innovation. By the end of this lesson, students will have a thorough understanding of the prototyping and testing phases of the design process, the importance of user feedback, and how failure contributes to successful innovation. This lesson focuses on applying the knowledge gained so far to the course project, where students will ideate, prototype, and test their designs. It also includes preparation for the upcoming mid-term exam, which will assess their understanding of key concepts. By the end of this lesson, students will have completed the ideation, prototyping, and testing stages of their course project and will be well-prepared for the mid-term exam, consolidating their understanding of the design and invention process. This lesson explores the cognitive processes behind design and invention, focusing on how individual designers think and approach problems. Students will also learn about design research methods used with designers and inventors to understand their decision-making and creative processes. By the end of this lesson, students will have a clearer understanding of how designers and inventors think, the cognitive processes that drive their creativity, and how to apply design research methods to study these processes. This lesson builds on the cognitive processes explored in Part 1, focusing on designing and inventing in teams. Students will examine team dynamics, the development of design expertise, and the role of novices and experts in the design process. By the end of this lesson, students will have a deeper understanding of how design expertise develops, the dynamics of designing in teams, and the research that supports effective team collaboration in the design and invention process. This lesson focuses on wrapping up the course and preparing for the final assessment. Students will complete the final part of their course project and review key concepts to prepare for the final exam. By the end of this lesson, students will have completed their course project and will be fully prepared for the final exam, having synthesized the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course. The SYSEN 555: Invention & Creative Design course provides students with a comprehensive foundation in invention and creative problem-solving, critical for advancing careers in industries driven by innovation, such as technology, manufacturing, and design. The course\u2019s focus on ideation, prototyping, and iterative testing equips students with practical experience that directly applies to real-world product development. By learning to think creatively and work collaboratively, students improve their problem-solving and critical thinking skills, enhancing their potential to work in roles like product manager, industrial designer, innovation consultant, or development engineer. Furthermore, the course\u2019s attention to patenting and intellectual property opens doors for careers in patent law and product protection. A real-world example of how the SYSEN 555: Invention & Creative Design course applies to industry can be seen in the development of innovative consumer products, like the creation of the Fitbit. The process of designing and developing the Fitbit required extensive research, ideation, prototyping, and testing\u2014key concepts taught in the course. Designers and engineers worked together in teams to understand the user\u2019s needs (empathize), define the problem (define), brainstorm ideas (ideate), and create prototypes that could be tested with real users. Throughout this process, they iterated on their design based on user feedback and market trends, much like the design thinking approach students learn in this course.

The PDR, the course\u2019s primary deliverable, will showcase the students\u2019 ability to manage and execute complex systems projects, providing a strong portfolio piece that highlights a systems-thinking approach\u2014a skill highly sought after by employers. This is the capstone course for the systems engineering program and is intended to be a unifying experience. The overall objective is to integrate knowledge from previous courses by applying a systems approach in the development of an engineered system.\u00a0 Students will create a Preliminary Design Report. There are two recommended resources for this course, as noted below. A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin, p. 41). The following grading system applies to graduate students: Grades will be a combination of Group assignments (70%) and Individual assignments (30%). Grades\u00a0will be based on the following scale: A = 90-100, A- = 85-89, B+ = 80-84, B = 75-79, B- = 70-74, C+ = 65-69, C = 60-64, D = 50-59, and F = Below 50. Communication is essential to successful completion of a systems design and therefore an essential part of this course. Most of your communication will be through the group spaces provided in Canvas.\u00a0 This group space will allow you to work together asynchronously and synchronously through discussion forums and conferences. The group spaces also provide space for files which you will want to take advantage of, particularly as your working documents become large. As your project progresses, you will find it necessary to have synchronous virtual meetings. Be sure to record your meeting for later viewing by myself or from members of your group who may have been unable to attend. In the past, some groups have elected to hold conference calls using calling facilities available through one of the group member\u2019s work place. This is acceptable as well, although if you choose this option, please record detailed meeting notes and to post these notes after the call. All these communication methods allow your instructor to follow your work and offer suggestions, when appropriate. Furthermore, as you see from the grading rubric, your grade is based on a group portion as well as an individual portion. Following your discussions and chats allows your instructor to more accurately assess your individual contributions. It may be helpful for your group to have a Project Manager. You should be familiar with the role of the project manager. The project manager would be expected to play a smaller technical role and take on the major responsibility of planning, organization, and implementation of the system engineering functions of your project. The project manager would also be the point of contact for the customer, i.e. the instructor! As added incentive for assuming the role of project manager you\u2019ll see in the grading section below, that a portion of your overall grade is based on your individual contribution to the project. Doing a good job as project manager is one way to maximize this portion of your grade. The final project, Preliminary Design Report, will be completed as a group. Details are provided in the course modules. Groups are required to submit three progress reports throughout the course.\u00a0 Details are provided in the course modules. *subject to change Progress reports are written to inform the customer about progress you\u2019ve made on a project over a certain period of time. Progress reports are written typically for projects that span more than several months or ones that are time critical (such as this one!). Progress reports serve several functions. In particular they: Ask yourselves: \u201cWould your preliminary design report convince someone that your system design satisfies the system requirements?\u201d In Lesson 1 you reviewed the major elements of the preliminary design report and saw examples of how the report can be structured.\u00a0You developed this further in your report outline.\u00a0Keep in mind the objective of the preliminary design phase is to demonstrate that the system concept satisfies the system requirements and that correct design choices have been made.

Additionally, having this expertise can open doors to senior roles like Business Analyst or Product Manager, leading to career growth and potentially higher compensation.Careers Indeed Jobs One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Dominare Fundamenta Incertitudinis Modulationis Unlocking Your Potential Course Requirements and GradingHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticsunderstand core concepts such as data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, classes, modules, and files; apply these programming concepts to create fully functional Python programs; gain a clear concept of the need for and use of abstraction in Computer Science; increased vocabulary of useful programming constructs; learn different tools used for writing and running Python code; allow a better choice of programming language constructs; and ability to learn a new language.following through the provided material(s); assessment of multiple choice and/or fill-in-the-blanks questions in tests after each lecture; and comprehensive labs and assignments that follow each lecture.ZyBooks: Data Structures Essentials: Pseudocode with Python Examples with ZyLabs (ISBN: 979-8-203-44388-5) ZyBooks: Programming in Python 3 with ZyLabs (ISBN: 979-8-203-44383-0)\n\nTo access zyBooks for this course, click on the zyBooks found in Module 1.\nLaunch the zyBooks platforms and subscribe.\nThe cost of a subscription is $99 for the year.

Rational entities can be termed as\u00a0agents\u00a0which can discern the environment via\u00a0sensors\u00a0and deliver actions on their environment through\u00a0actuators.\u00a0 An AI agent can be programmed to acquire the behavioral properties e.g., knowledge, belief, intention, etc. An Agent runs in a sequence of sensing, believing, and acting. An agent can be: We segregate the game playing strategy into two categories based on the information accessed by the agents. A game with the perfect information is one in which the agents can see the whole environment or state space. Agents have all the information about the search space and the moves or actions of the opponents. Example of such games are Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Checkers, etc. Imperfect information is when the agents in an adversarial environment do not have access the full information about the game in terms of action-states pairs, though the environment is fully visible. This type of game is called the imperfect information game. The examples of imperfect information games are Battleship, blind, Bridge, etc. Building Decision Trees Decision trees belong to a class of recursive partitioning algorithms that are\u00a0simple to describe and implement. The determination of the \u201cbest\u201d can be made in many ways, but regardless of the metric, they all provide a measure of purity of class distribution. Every input variable is a candidate for every split, so that the same variable can be used for every split in the decision tree. Decision trees are non-linear predictors. It means that decision boundary between target variable classes is non-linear. The extent of non-linearities depends on the number of splits in the tree as each split is a piecewise constant separator as shown in figure 2. As the tree becomes more complex, the depth increases, and more piecewise constant separators are built into the decision boundary providing the non-linear separation.

Designing architectures of software-intensive systems can be challenging. The requirements that drive a system\u2019s architecture are often quite different from the requirements that define the functionality of a system. They have a longer-term impact on the system than most functional requirements, some are highly subjective or difficult to articulate, they have non-obvious interactions with each other, and many stakeholders don\u2019t understand the architectural implications of what they need, so they are likely to overlook some of their architecturally significant requirements. The architecture must anticipate change in the functional requirements, in business conditions, in available technologies, in the development organization itself, and so forth. The architecture must also be stabilized while many functional and business requirements are still unstable. Architecturally significant requirements can be difficult to test before the system is operational. They often have cross-cutting impact, making shortcomings difficult to correct after development has progressed, and thus making them high risk. So, another objective of this course is to introduce you to fundamental concepts, techniques and methods used for creating and managing architectures of software intensive systems. (3 credits) A software architecture is an abstract view of a software system distinct from the details of how such a system is implemented. It plays a significant role in developing software systems that meet quality expectations (such as performance, scalability, availability, maintainability, etc.) of their stakeholders.

Unit/Lesson Objectives: Empowering Readings: Mastering software engineering architecture offers multifaceted benefits that extend beyond the mere construction of software systems. At its core, a robust understanding of architectural principles enhances the design and integration of scalable, resilient, and adaptable systems. Such systems cater to current requirements while being flexible to evolving business and technological landscapes. From an academic perspective, proficiency in software architecture instills a holistic view of systems, fostering a deep comprehension of the trade-offs associated with design decisions. This capability is essential for the critical evaluation of contemporary architectures and the innovative creation of novel structures. Additionally, mastery in this domain promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, as architectural considerations often intersect with fields such as human-computer interaction, cybersecurity, and data science. Consequently, an adeptness in software engineering architecture not only augments the quality and longevity of software solutions but also cultivates a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. Software engineering architecture is a crucial skill, particularly evident when examining the evolution of modern digital platforms like streaming services. Consider Netflix, which began as a DVD rental service but pivoted to a global streaming behemoth. The architectural decisions behind this platform have played an instrumental role in its success. As Netflix expanded its user base and diversified its content offerings, its initial monolithic architecture was not scalable enough to accommodate the exponential growth in traffic and the diverse range of devices accessing the service. Leveraging the principles of software engineering architecture, Netflix transitioned to a microservices-based architecture. This allowed different components of the platform, such as recommendation engines, user profiles, and content delivery systems, to evolve, scale, and fail independently without affecting the entire ecosystem. Such an architectural overhaul ensured that millions of users could simultaneously stream content without latency, glitches, or outages. Another real-world example is the development and operation of smart cities. As urban areas worldwide integrate technology to improve infrastructure, transportation, energy management, and public services, software engineering architecture becomes pivotal. The complex interplay of sensors, databases, user interfaces, and control systems demands an architectural framework that is both robust and flexible. For instance, in a smart traffic management system, real-time data from traffic lights, cameras, and vehicle sensors must be processed efficiently to control traffic flow, predict congestions, and manage emergencies. Mastery in software engineering architecture ensures that such systems can not only handle massive concurrent data streams but also integrate with other systems like public transportation or emergency services. The coherence and efficiency of these integrated systems are a direct reflection of the architectural expertise underpinning their design and operation. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Course Topics Unlocking Your PotentialHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsFundamental concepts underlying software architecture Forces that shape the architecture The role of architectural design concepts\u00a0in addressing these forces Techniques and methods for creating, documenting, evaluating, and managing an architecture Case studies and examples of architectures of software intensive systemsDefine software architecture and explain its role in software-intensive systems.

The learning assessment in BUSAD 826 will be based on individual and team assignments, including quizzes, a final exam, and two team projects. After you have submitted an assignment, you will typically be able to review your grade and any comments made by your instructor within 7 days after the due date. This process is used for all homework assignments, exams, or other graded submissions. Some instructors may send you a message informing you the assignment has been graded. Some instructors may also choose to release all the grades to all students at once; other instructors may release grades per student one at a time. The graded activities and the percentage of your course grade associated with the activities are as follows: *Grades will be based on the following scale: A = 94 and above, A- = 90-93.9, B+ = 87-89.9, B =84-86.9, B- = 80-83.9, C+ = 77-79.9, C = 70-76.9, D = 60-69.9, and F = Below 60 The instructor may post several discussion questions to a general discussion forum for each of the first two weeks and students are encouraged to participate in the discussion. Your participation is voluntary,\u00a0and you will not be graded on these discussions. The discussions will be used to enhance your learning experience. Quizzes 1 and 2 consist of problem-solving questions designed to assess your mastery of the main concepts learned from Lessons 1 and 2. Quizzes 1 and 2 will be completed online where you will download the quiz file to your computer, provide solutions to the problem-solving questions, and then upload your Excel solution file. Each team will analyze two companies, Walmart (WMT) during the residency period and a company to be announced (TBA) as the final project. Please see the course schedule for due dates for each of the team projects.\u00a0Details of the projects will be discussed in class during the residency week. The WMT project experience during the residency period will serve as a practice to prepare you for the final project. As such the WMT project has only a 10% weight. Each team will prepare a financial analysis, financial projection, and valuation for the company, including pro forma financial statements and a valuation model in Excel, a written report in Word, and a presentation in PowerPoint. The report should not exceed 5 pages, double-spaced. Font size should be 12 points for headings and 10 points for text. An appendix can be attached without any limit on the number of pages. Each team will present the WMT project in class during the residency week. Each team member must deliver a portion of this team presentation and will be evaluated individually. For the final team project, your team will analyze a company that will be announced by the instructor during the residency week. The final project has a 40% weight, and consists of three parts: The final exam is designed to test your: *Subject to change You have learned from the time value of money concept, stock and bond valuation, and capital budgeting in BA831\u00a0that\u00a0discount rate is a necessary input to compute present value.\u00a0 As such, it is also\u00a0one of the critical input variables for valuing a company.\u00a0 Discount rate is sometimes called required return or cost of capital.\u00a0\u00a0This section describes how to estimate the cost of equity capital. (SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE) The formulas listed below should have been covered in an introductory finance course such as BA831, or MBADM820 (formerly FIN 531). They are listed here to refresh your memory because they will be used often in this course. You might want to review them in one of the financial management textbooks by Brealey-Myers-Allen or Welch listed in the syllabus. The first formula we will look at is the constant dividend model.

Table 2.1 shows partial results from a financial forecast for TRI. The tax rate is 35%. Next, you will find some questions that you should consider. The answers will be discussed throughout this lesson. Question 1: How would you go about estimating the amount of cash flow available to all equity holders, assuming TRI is a 100% equity-financed company? This amount is called the free cash flow (FCF). Question 2: The value of the firm was estimated in Lesson 1 as the PV of all FCFs discounted at the unlevered cost of equity of 9%. Now suppose TRI decided to borrow $61 now and pay down $3 per year from Year 1 through Year 5 with the outstanding debt balance of $46 at the end of Year 5. The interest rate on debt is 7%. (SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE) Free cash flow\u00a0is the cash produced from the operating activities of a firm and is available for distribution to shareholders as if the firm is an all-equity (unlevered) firm after making all required investments in the business necessary to sustain the firm\u2019s assets and future growth. There are several important characteristics of FCF to become familiar with: FCF vs. Net Income (NI): It is important to recognize the difference between FCF and Net income. FCF will increase or turn positive as growth slows down and profits from past investments grow. This is because a slower growth requires smaller investments in CAPEX and net working capital. Increasing FCF and increased profit also increase FCF. Since FCF is the cash from operating activities, it is important to separate The operating value of a firm, levered or unlevered, is defined as the present value of all FCFs discounted by tax-adjusted WACC for the corresponding capital structure. Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) is a measure of how much cash is available for distribution to the common shareholders (exclude preferred shareholders) after required investment in working capital, property, plant, and equipment needed to sustain the firm\u2019s assets and future growth and after required distributions to nonequity claimholders (debt, preferred stock, options) have been paid. Based on the definition on FCF in the previous section, the FCF calculation can be expressed as: FCF\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 EBIT \u00b7 (1 \u2013\u00a0tc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 Noncash expenses such as depreciation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 CAPEX (investment in fixed assets)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Change in net working capital (investment in working capital) Based on the definition of FCFE in the previous section, the\u00a0FCFE calculation\u00a0can be expressed as: FCFE \u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 FCF \u2013 \u00a0 All cash interest \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Preferred stock dividends + \u00a0 Tax shelter from financing charges (ITS) \u2013 \u00a0 Principal repayments + \u00a0 Proceeds from new debt issues + \u00a0 New preferred stock issued + \u00a0 Stock buyback \u2013 \u00a0 New common stock issued The\u00a0FCF calculation: starting from EBIT\u00a0can be expressed as: FCF Calculation: Starting From EBIT\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 EBIT\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 Noncash expenses (e.g., depreciation, amortization)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Noncash revenues (e.g., revenue accruals)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tc\u00a0\u00b7 EBIT (cash tax payments without interest tax shields, or ITS)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Increase in net working capital\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CAPEX (new fixed assets purchased)\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free Cash Flow Note: Check if nonoperating gains and expenses are embedded within EBIT. Some companies may embed nonoperating gains and expenses within EBIT. If so, these items need to be excluded. Examples of nonoperating gains and expenses include, but are not limited to These are advanced topics beyond the scope of this course. If you are interested, read \u201cMcKinsey Part V: Advanced Valuation Issues.\u201d In this section, we will discuss Example 1 (FCF Calculation for TRI).\u00a0EBIT, depreciation, CAPEX, and Change in NWC are forecasted for TRI for the next six years based on a forecasting model for TRI\u2019s financial statements (income statement, balance sheet statement, and cash flow statement). Estimate FCF forecast for the next six years. Assume the income tax rate for TRI is 35%. Note: the data in Table 2.2 includes the same information from the overview of Section 2. Click on Example 1 (FCF Calculation for TRI) to view the solution: An alternative to the EBIT method is to calculate FCF from the statement of cash flows. Specifically, FCF may be calculated starting from net income in the section on cash flows from operating activities (CFO): FCF Calculation: Starting From Net Income (CFO Method) FCF Calculation: Starting From Net Income (CFO Method)\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 Net income (profit after tax)\u00a0\u00a0 +\u00a0\u00a0 Noncash expenses (e.g., depreciation, amortization)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Noncash revenues\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Increase in current assets\u00a0\u00a0 + \u00a0\u00a0Increase in current liability\u00a0\u00a0 = \u00a0 After-tax cash flows from operation (from statement of cash flows)\u00a0\u00a0 + \u00a0 After-tax interest payment (net)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0\u00a0CAPEX (new fixed assets purchased)\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free Cash Flow Note regarding after-tax interest payments (net): Adding back after-tax interest payments (net) neutralizes the effect of interest payments on the firm\u2019s profit because FCF measures the cash produced by the business/operating activity of the firm. Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents (marketable securities) are excluded from the current assets (CA) by some and included by others depending upon their views on the cash and marketable securities (C&MS) being either part of, or not part of, the operating activities.

WACC Method Industry WACC: It is often more useful to use industry WACCs when a company has more than one division in different industries. It will produce more reliable estimates of the firm value if each division is valued separately using an industry WACC corresponding to the division\u2019s industry.

A relevant real-world example in corporate finance is the decision-making process behind Apple\u2019s capital allocation strategy. Apple\u2019s approach to managing its massive cash reserves, which have reached over $200 billion in recent years, is a textbook example of corporate finance in action. In response to shareholder pressure, Apple has used a combination of stock buybacks, dividend payments, and strategic investments in R&D to balance returning value to shareholders while maintaining the necessary capital for innovation. This example illustrates the importance of financial management decisions in balancing growth opportunities, risk management, and shareholder value. Students in BUSAD 826 can explore these strategies by analyzing Apple\u2019s capital structure, dividend policies, and risk assessments to understand how corporate finance decisions affect long-term business success. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Course Requirements and Grading Unlocking Your Potential Which One?

Interest Income: Interest income is included in NI calculation, but excluded for nonfinancial firms because it is not an operating income for a nonfinancial firm. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation are subtracted from revenue when NI is calculated, but not when FCF is calculated. CAPEX and Investment in Net Working Capital (NWC) are not expenses and, hence, they are not factors influencing NI (i.e., they do not appear in any income statement), but they reduce FCF. FCF can be negative (FCF < 0) for a rapidly growing business even if the business is profitable (NI > 0) if CAPEX and Investment in NWC are large.Operating assets and liabilities from\u00a0non-operating\u00a0assets and liabilities, such as financial assets and liabilities; and Operating income and expenses from\u00a0non-operating\u00a0income and expenses, such as income and expenses from financial assets and liabilities (interest) and from discontinued operation.

In this case, be sure to exclude short-term debts from current liabilities.Cost of equity (levered): Use the stock market data to estimate the equity beta and apply CAPM. Cost of debt: Use the borrowing rate of the company, the yield to maturity of the company\u2019s bonds, or the bond yield of similarly rated companies. Cost of capital of convertible bonds: complicated because it is a combination of straight bonds and options on stock. Cost of junk bonds: complicated, but promised yields may be used as approximations of expected yield under an assumption that the default risk is low.

The course is designed for prospective students who aim to understand how accounting data informs decision-making for both external stakeholders (e.g., investors and regulators) and internal users (e.g., managers). Key topics include analyzing an organization\u2019s financial position, planning short- and long-term activities, motivating behavior, evaluating performance, and addressing corporate governance issues. Students will also explore foundational managerial accounting concepts, gaining insights into how accounting influences strategic and operational decisions. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to both financial accounting (focusing on external users of accounting information) and managerial accounting (focusing on internal users of accounting information).\u00a0 The course focuses on the uses (and potential misuses) of accounting information.\u00a0 We will also discuss corporate governance issues.\u00a0 Accounting information can be used to evaluate an organization\u2019s financial position, to plan future activities (short and long-term), to motivate behavior, and to evaluate performance.\u00a0 The focus is NOT to train students to produce accounting information.\u00a0 Rather, the focus is to train students to interpret, evaluate, and use accounting information. We will also introduce managerial accounting topics in this course.

The best preparation is to focus on the assigned questions. The fact that classes are scheduled is evidence that the faculty believes class instruction is important. Therefore, class attendance is important for the benefit of students. Accordingly, it is the policy of the University that class attendance by students be encouraged and that all instructors organize and conduct their courses with this policy in mind. A student should attend every class for which the student is scheduled and should be held responsible for all work covered in the courses taken. In each case, the instructor should decide when the class absence constitutes a danger to the student\u2019s scholastic attainment and should make this fact known to the student at once. A student whose irregularity in attendance causes the student, in the judgment of the instructor, to become deficient scholastically may run the risk of receiving a failing grade or receiving a lower grade than the student might have secured had the student been in regular attendance. *Subject to change 1.\u00a0 Increase Inventory by the LIFO reserve 2.\u00a0 Increase tax liabilities by the tax rate applied to the LIFO reserve 3.\u00a0 Increase retained earnings by the difference 1.\u00a0 Increase Inventory by $2,009 million (add the LIFO reserve) 2.\u00a0 Increase tax liabilities by $693 million 3.\u00a0 Increase retained earnings by the difference of $1,316 million (computed as $2,009 million \u2013 $693 million). 1.\u00a0 Decrease Cogs by $75 million (the increase in the LIFO reserve) 2.\u00a0 Increase tax expense by $16 million ($75 million x 21% tax rate) 3.\u00a0 Increase net income by the difference of $59 million (computed as $75 million \u2013 $16 million). \u008c1- Cost of goods sold is adjusted for the change in inventory to determine the amount of purchases during the year. \u008d2- Purchases is adjusted for the change in accounts payable to derive the cash paid for inventory purchases.

ACCTG 800: Financial & Managerial Accounting equips students with critical skills in analyzing and interpreting financial data, which are essential for making informed business decisions. By mastering financial statements, cost analysis, and performance evaluation tools like the balanced scorecard, students are prepared for roles in accounting, finance, and business management. This course enhances career prospects by enabling students to effectively communicate financial insights to both internal and external stakeholders, guiding strategic decisions, optimizing resource allocation, and driving organizational performance. As financial and managerial accounting is foundational in almost every industry, the skills gained from this course open doors to diverse career opportunities in areas such as auditing, financial planning, and managerial accounting. In ACCTG 800, students learn to apply accounting concepts to real-world scenarios. For example, consider a company like Apple Inc., which uses financial accounting to report quarterly earnings to investors, helping them assess the company\u2019s financial health through income statements and balance sheets. At the same time, Apple\u2019s managers use managerial accounting to analyze cost behavior and set pricing strategies for new products. By using cost-volume-profit analysis, they determine how many units of a product need to be sold to break even and achieve profitability. Through this course, students learn to interpret and analyze such reports, making them valuable assets in any organization, capable of guiding financial decisions and strategic planning. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley LIFO Liquidations Unlocking Your Potential Lesson 7: Group Project Discussion and Submission Writing CenterHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsAnalyze an organization\u2019s financial statements and compare to industry and key competitors Assess the quality of an organization\u2019s earnings Evaluate an organization\u2019s working capital management Understand relevant cost and revenue items in decision-making (CVP, for example) Understand how managerial accounting information is used to evaluate performance (of customers, business units, individuals, quality initiatives, etc.) Understand the rationale and implementation of the Balanced Scorecard Understand budgeting and forecasting processes and the behavioral implications of these processesYou can purchase eBook with Access code for $130.\n\nhttps://cambridgepub.com/book/finman6e#purchase. https://cambridgepub.com/book/finman6e#purchase.

This creates a liability (Unearned Revenue) for the company\u2019s obligation to deliver a good or perform a service at a future date. When the good is provided or the service rendered, the unearned revenue liability is reduced and\u00a0 revenue is recognized. Lowe\u2019s Companies reports unearned (deferred) revenue details:If deferred revenue liabilities decrease, we infer the company\u2019s current reported revenue was collected from customers in a prior accounting period and there have been fewer new prepayments for which revenue will be recognized in the future. Such a trend could predict future declines in revenue and profit. Meanwhile, large swings (increase or decrease) in unearned revenue should be thoroughly investigated. Why? This is not the case for Lowe\u2019s. The company reports a reconciliation of the unearned (deferred) revenue account.Lower of Cost or Market LCM LIFO Disclosures for a LIFO ReserveLower of cost or market rule says:\u00a0 if the market value of inventory is less than its cost \u201cwrite down\u201d the inventory to its market value. For example, Home Depot uses FIFO costing method. At the end of each accounting period, Home Depot compares ending FIFO inventory balance with market value (replacement cost) and writes down inventory if cost is less than market value. This noncash expense, reflected in COGS, reduces gross profit:We use the following equation to adjust LIFO to FIFO Inventory: In general, we make three adjustments to convert LIFO to FIFO on the balance sheet:For example, to adjust CAT\u2019s 2018 balance sheet from LIFO to FIFO:We use the following equation to adjust LIFO to FIFO COGS:During the year, the change in the LIFO reserve represents the difference in LIFO vs. FIFO COGS during the current year. FIFO COGS will be lower, which causes higher pretax profit, higher income tax, and higher net income. For example, to adjust CAT\u2019s 2018 income statementBecause companies can choose among various inventory costing methods, financial statements are not comparable. Compare CAT to a close foreign competitor Kubota,\u00a0 a company that uses FIFO (only U.S. tax law permits LIFO method):When companies reduce inventory levels, older inventory costs flow to the income statement. These older LIFO costs are often markedly different from current replacement costs. Assuming an inflationary environment, sales of older pools often boost gross profit as older, lower costs are matched against current selling prices on the income statement. This event is called a LIFO liquidation. For example, Rite Aid\u2019s 2019 10-K reports the following:The direct method presents net cash flow from operating activities by showing the major categories\u00a0 of operating cash receipts and payments. Only the format of the operating section differs between the two methods, not the total amount of cash generated from operating activities. The net cash flows from investing and financing are identical to those prepared using the indirect method. The operating cash receipts and payments are usually determined by converting the accrual revenues and expenses to corresponding cash amounts.The conversion is a two-step process:We compute cash paid for merchandise purchased\u00a0 as follows:No adjustment to wages expense of $52,000 is needed. The absence of any beginning or ending accrued liability for wages payable means wages expense and cash paid to employees as wages are the same amount. If wages payable were present, we would subtract (add) an increase (decrease) from wage expense to derive cash paid to employees.Prepaid insurance increased during the year. The increase reflects the excess of cash paid for insurance over the year\u2019s insurance expense. Starting with the insurance expense, the cash paid for insurance is computed as follows:The increase in income tax payable during the year, means that income tax expense was greater than tax payments. Starting with income tax expense, we calculate cash paid for income taxes as follows:This is the same $ operating cash flow as the indirect method\u2015only the format differs. The reporting of investing and financing activities in\u00a0 the statement of cash flows is identical under the indirect and direct methods.This is essentially the indirect method of computing cash flow from operating activities. Thus, when the direct method is used in the statement of cash flows, the indirect method is a required separate disclosure.Analyze an organization\u2019s financial statements and compare to industry and key competitors Assess the quality of an organization\u2019s earnings Evaluate an organization\u2019s working capital management Understand relevant cost and revenue items in decision-making (CVP, for example) Understand how managerial accounting information is used to evaluate performance (of customers, business units, individuals, quality initiatives, etc.) Understand the rationale and implementation of the Balanced Scorecard Understand budgeting and forecasting processes and the behavioral implications of these processesL1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7Financial Statements: Learn about the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement and their role in evaluating a company\u2019s financial health.

The other terms are mentioned only to make you aware of them should you encounter them in other arenas. Simple linear regression gets its adjective \u201csimple,\u201d because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable. In contrast, multiple linear regression, which we study later in this course, gets its adjective \u201cmultiple,\u201d because it concerns the study of two or more predictor variables. efore proceeding, we must clarify what types of relationships we won\u2019t study in this course, namely,\u00a0deterministic\u00a0(or\u00a0functional)\u00a0relationships. Here is an example of a deterministic relationship. When conducting a residual analysis, a \u201cresiduals versus fits plot\u201d is the most frequently created plot. It is a scatter plot of residuals on the\u00a0y-axis\u00a0and fitted values (estimated responses) on the\u00a0x-axis. The plot is used to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers. Let\u2019s look at an example to see what a \u201cwell-behaved\u201d residual plot looks like. Some researchers (Urbano-Marquez,\u00a0et al., 1989) were interested in determining whether or not alcohol consumption was linearly related to muscle strength. The researchers measured the total lifetime consumption of alcohol (x) on a random sample of\u00a0n\u00a0= 50 alcoholic men. They also measured the strength (y) of the deltoid muscle in each person\u2019s non-dominant arm. A fitted line plot of the resulting data, (Alcohol Arm data), looks like this: The plot suggests that there is a decreasing linear relationship between alcohol and arm strength. It also suggests that there are no unusual data points in the data set. And, it illustrates that the variation around the estimated regression line is constantly suggesting that the assumption of equal error variances is reasonable. First, we will illustrate Minitab\u2019s \u201cBest Subsets\u201d procedure and a \u201cby hand\u201d calculation of the information criteria from earlier. Recall from\u00a0Lesson 6\u00a0that this dataset consists of variables possibly relating to blood pressures of\u00a0n\u00a0= 39 Peruvians who have moved from rural high-altitude areas to urban lower-altitude areas (Peru dataset). The variables in this dataset (where we have omitted the calf skinfold variable from the first time we used this example) are: Again, follow\u00a0Stat > Regression >\u00a0Regression >\u00a0Best Subsets\u00a0in Minitab. The results of this procedure are presented below. To interpret the results, we start by noting that the lowest\u00a0Cp\u00a0value (= 5.5) occurs for the five-variable model that includes the variables\u00a0Age,\u00a0Years,\u00a0fraclife,\u00a0Weight, and\u00a0Chin.

Additionally, having this expertise can open doors to senior roles like Business Analyst or Product Manager, leading to career growth and potentially higher compensation.Careers Indeed Jobs One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Dominare Fundamenta Incertitudinis Modulationis Unlocking Your Potential Course Requirements and GradingHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsEmploy statistical descriptive and inferential techniques Apply theories of probability Make predictions using linear modelsfollowing through the provided material content (zyBook) assessment of assigned activities or quizzes in each ModuleZyBook: Statistics for Decision Making (ISBN: 979-8-203-44340-3)zyBooks is interactive, online learning content that replaces a traditional textbook with less text and more action.\n\nTo Access your zyBook for this course click on the zyBook assignment in Module 1.\u00a0 Launch the zyBook platform and subscribe.\u00a0 The cost of subscription is $64.\u00a0\u00a0\n If you need assistance with zyBooks, contact the\u00a0zyBooks Help CenterLinks to an external site..

This course will include the following assignment categories. *Includes Peer Evaluation of team functioning. Letter grades will be based on the following scale: Helping you to enhance skills and competencies related to group dynamics and teaming is a principle goal of the OMBA. Consequently, this course includes team activities and group work that allows for the application of teaming concepts that you learned in the Team Performance course (MBADM 810). You are expected to work in teams effectively and productively to complete all team assignments.\u00a0Students may not request to work individually on team projects. Any adjustments to team composition are the sole right of the instructor.\u00a0If you have concerns related to this commitment, please contact your instructor. The content in this course is challenging. I anticipate that you may have questions as you progress through the readings and assignments. To ensure that your questions are answered, several Zoom sessions have been scheduled to occur throughout the semester. The dates and times of each session are located on the Canvas Syllabus page as well as in the Course Schedule.\u00a0The Zoom\u00a0sessions are\u00a0not\u00a0mandatory and are not graded, but I encourage you to attend. Recordings of all Zoom sessions will be available for your review in the course Media Gallery. There is one case study assignment\u00a0throughout the course of the semester.\u00a0Read the assigned case study (procure through Harvard Business Review;\u00a0see the Required Materials section in the Syllabus for the link to HBR). Respond to the question prompts included in the assignment instructions. Keep in mind that these are team-based assignments that include an evaluation of how each team member contributes to the completion of the assignment. Active and engaged participation by all team members in team-based assignments is important. You are required to contribute to generating ideas for the cases and writing the paper, and you must be accountable to your team on time and effort commitments. As a result, you will be required to complete a peer evaluation for each member of your group at the conclusion of each of the case study discussions. While the case study is a team-based project, your contributions to your team will be evaluated and used to generate your individual score for the case study assignment. Each evaluation will have the same 4 questions, rated on a scale of 1\u20137. Contributions will be evaluated on four factors: Cooperation, Participation and Commitment, Idea Generation, and Quality of Written Contributions. This evaluation will be completed by your group members as a peer evaluation. The results of the Peer Evaluation may include an increase or a decrease in your overall grade for this assignment. Students who receive high scores for their contributions to their team may receive up to a 10-point increase in their grade (i.e., \u201cextra credit\u201d). Students who receive lower scores for their contributions will receive a deduction from their grades. As a professional, you are expected to act with the highest level of integrity and an exemplary work ethic. Likewise, in this course, you are required to adhere to the Smeal Honor Code and the Penn State University Code of Conduct, and also to hold your peers accountable to the same standards. In team assignments, you should do your share of the work, on time, and to the best of your ability. In discussions, always be courteous and accepting of others\u2019 thoughts. Be supportive of classmates on assignments that allow or encourage collaboration. Keep in mind that you are in this course to study and learn new material that will benefit you in the future; you are not here to simply get a grade in the easiest way possible. Enjoy and embrace the learning experience with an ethical mindset, and you will always be proud of your work. *Subject to change Inflation reduces the purchasing power of future dollars. In this economy, the only good produced is\u00a0potatoes. If you lend $100 at\u00a0t\u00a0= 0 for 1 year at a nominal rate\u00a0rN\u00a0= 10%, then at\u00a0t\u00a0= 1 you will receive 100(1 +\u00a0rN) = $110. If the price of potato at\u00a0t\u00a0= 0 is P0\u00a0= $1.00 per pound, then you have\u00a0given up\u00a0100 lb. of potatoes by lending $100. If the price of potato has not changed at\u00a0t\u00a0= 1 (so, P1\u00a0= P0\u00a0= $1.00 per pound), then you will be able to buy 110 lb. of potatoes. That\u2019s a\u00a010% return in potatoes. But suppose the potato price has changed at\u00a0t\u00a0= 1: P1\u00a0= P0(1 +\u00a0i) = $1.05 per pound. That\u2019s\u00a05% inflation. $110 at t = 1 will buy \n  \n\n\n\n110\n\n\n\nP\n1\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n110\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n=\n104.76\n\n\n  lb. of potatoes. The real rate of return in potatoes =\n\n  \n\n\nr\nR\n\n=\n\n\n104.76\n\u2212\n100\n\n\n100\n\n\n=\n0.0476\n=\n4.76%\n\n\n  or\n  \n\n104.76\n=\n100\n(\n\n1\n+\n0.0476\n\n)\n=\n100\n(\n\n1\n+\n\nr\nR\n\n\n) The Fisher equation shows the relationship between the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and the inflation. This relationship can be illustrated using the potato economy case: The amount of potatoes that can be purchased using the loan proceeds\u00a0is equal to the\u00a0amount of potatoes given up by lending $100 at\u00a0t\u00a0= 0\u00a0plus the amount of additional potatoes earned from the lending (See Figure 1.2). 100\n\n\n1\n+\n\nr\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\n1\n+\ni\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n100\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\nr\nR (1+rt)=(1+rR)(1+i)(1+rt)=(1+rR)(1+i)\u00a0: Fisher equation for a single period Rearranging the Fisher equation for a single period and solve for the nominal rate, we get the following: EG:\u00a0rNOM\u00a0= 10% and\u00a0iexp\u00a0= 5%. Then\u00a0rREAL\u00a0= 1.1 / 1.05 \u2212 1 = 0.0476 (4.76%) Consider the following certificate of deposits (CD) maturing in 15 years: (Similar to the PV formula with the discount rate replaced by the inflation.) In the real world, the interest rates are different for different maturity. Sometimes a short-term rate may be lower than a longer-term rate. Other times, the opposite may be the case. The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between\u00a0interest rate\u00a0and\u00a0maturity, where the interest rate refers to the nominal interest rates on default-free, pure discount bond. The pure discount interest rate is the interest rate on a single lump-sum future payment without any risk of default. The present value of a single lump-sum future payment is naturally less than the lump-sum amount, and so it is called\u00a0discount bond. The rate of return on a Treasury bill (T-bill) is an example of pure discount interest rate since a T-bill pays a lump-sum amount (face value) at the end of maturity with no payments before the maturity. However, rates of return on Treasury notes (T-note) or bonds (T-bond) are\u00a0not\u00a0pure discount interest rates since they pay coupons every 6 months until maturity in addition to the face value at maturity. Firms need financing for capital expenditures (CAPEX) and working capital. The sources of financing are internally generated cash flows, long-term debt such as bonds, common stocks, and preferred stocks. A brief overview of long-term debt, preferred stocks, and common stocks are described on this page. This section is brief with an expectation that you will learn details of long-term financing topics from studying the assigned reading (Ross 11th\u00a0ed., Chapter 15). Long-term debt, such as a long-term bond, has contractual obligations to pay back a stated amount, including interest payments and maturity. Interest payments are treated as a business expense and are tax-deductible. The lenders may force bankruptcy if the borrower defaults on any payments, interest, or principal. The contractual obligations set in indentures\u00a0include\u00a0many other restrictions. An\u00a0indenture\u00a0is a legal contract specifying all the features of a bond, including maturity date, interest payment dates, interest calculation method, and other features such as callable or convertible, as well as any restrictions imposed on borrowers. Preferred stocks\u00a0entitle the holder to a fixed dividend periodically. The fixed dividend must be paid out before dividends to common shareholders, and the shares generally do not carry voting rights. Some features of preferred stock: Cumulative preferred stock\u00a0is a class of preferred stock that requires the corporation to make up any missed payments before resuming common stock dividends.\u00a0In case of liquidation, preferred shareholders have preference compared to common shareholders.\u00a0Preferred stock has some features of debt (fixed dividends, like fixed interest on debt), and common equity (potential to appreciate in price). Common stocks\u00a0are shares entitling the common shareholders to dividends and voting rights. Dividends vary in amount depending on the financial conditions of the firm. Dividends are not a business expense and firms are not required to pay dividends regularly. Common shareholders have residual claims on firm\u2019s earnings and assets after claims by debt holders and preferred shareholders. Stock buybacks\u00a0(share repurchase): Companies often repurchase shares of its own stock using its cash holding, but sometimes financed by borrowing. Stock buyback is another way of returning money to shareholders. This has the effect of changing debt-to-equity ratio (changing capital structure). There are two important questions on factors that determine the exchange rates. Spot exchange rates and\u00a0forward exchange rates\u00a0are interrelated with\u00a0domestic and foreign price indices\u00a0and\u00a0inflation rates, and\u00a0domestic and foreign interest rates.\u00a0Two main theorems connecting these variables and partially answering the two questions are:\u00a0Purchasing Power Parity\u00a0(PPP)\u00a0Theorem\u00a0and\u00a0Interest Rate Parity (IRP) Theorem.\u00a0This section explains the PPP, and the next section IRP. The PPP is based on the \u201claw of one price,\u201d meaning that price of an item is the same regardless of the currency used to purchase it. Suppose pure gold bullion is priced P$\u00a0= $1,200 per 1 troy ounce in the U.S. and the spot exchange rate between EUR and USD is S\u20ac/$\u00a0= \u20ac 0.8/$. Then the price of gold in France should be: \u20ac 0.8/$ x $1,200/oz = \u20ac 960 /oz. If the price of gold in France is different from \u20ac 960/oz, then there is an arbitrage profit-making opportunity. Suppose the price of gold in France is \u20ac 1,000/oz, then: If the price of gold in France is \u20ac 900/oz, lower than \u20ac 960, then buying gold in France and selling it in the U.S. will generate an arbitrage profit. Absolute Purchasing Power Parity\u00a0using notions: P\u20ac\u00a0= S\u20ac/$\u00a0x P$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1) Equivalently: S\u20ac/$\u00a0= P\u20ac\u00a0/ P$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2) Requirements for absolute PPP to hold: For most goods, Absolute PPP rarely holds in practice. The relative PPP offers information about what causes changes in exchange rates by expressing the expected future exchange rate in terms of inflations in foreign country and domestic inflation. (Assume USD is the home currency) S0,F/$: Spot exchange rate at t=0 in foreign currency per $1 (indirect quote) E (St,F/$): Expected spot exchange rate at a future date, t, in foreign currency per $1 P0,$:\u00a0 Home country (U.S.) price level at t=0 P0,F:\u00a0 Foreign country price level at t=0 h$: \u00a0\u00a0Expected U.S. inflation rate hF: \u00a0\u00a0Expected foreign country inflation rate From the Absolute PPP Eq (2), we get: Since \n\nE\n\n\nP\n\nt\n,\nF\n\n\n\n=\n\nP\n\n0\n,\nF\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\nh\nF\n\n\n\nt And\n\nE\n\n\nP\n\nt\n,\n$\n\n\n\n=\n\nP\n\n0\n,\n$\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\nh\n$\n\n\n\nt The Relative PPP is: Because absolute PPP does not hold for many goods, we will focus on relative PPP from here on out. Suppose the British pound exchange rate is currently 0.7407 GBP per dollar. The inflation rate in the U.K. over the next 5 years is expected to be 1.5% per year, whereas the U.S. inflation rate will be 3%. Based on relative PPP, what will the expected exchange rate be in 5 years? Because the U.S. inflation rate is higher, we expect that the dollar will become less valuable. The exchange rate change will be\u00a0approximately\u00a01.5% \u2013 3% = \u2013 1.5% per year. Over 5 years the exchange rate is expected to fall to: E(St=5,GBP/$) = (St=0,GBP/$) (1.015)5\u00a0/(1.03)5\u00a0= 0.7407(1.015)5\u00a0/(1.03)5\u00a0= GBP 0.688314/$ \u2192\u00a0 \u00a0The exchange rate is expected to decline from GBP 0.7407 to 0.6883, at an annual rate of decline of 1.456% per year. After having successfully completed this course, you will be able to do the following: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

Many people struggle with decision-making, often waiting until the last minute and hoping their challenges will resolve themselves. When the pressure is on, they rush through choices, convincing themselves they could have done better with more time. The reality is, most of us have never been formally taught how to make effective decisions\u2014we rely solely on past experiences or external advice. Yet, the toughest decisions often arise in unfamiliar territory, leaving us to navigate without a roadmap. In this course, you\u2019ll discover proven methodologies to enhance your decision-making process. Rather than telling you what to decide, we focus on teaching you how to decide. Whether you\u2019re facing personal or professional choices, you\u2019ll gain the skills needed to approach new situations with confidence, clarity, and a structured mindset. This course is designed to provide students with the insights into the decision making process, capabilities to examine and analyze decisions under uncertainties within the context of engineering and technology.

We denote decision alternatives as (d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots) and chance events (states of nature) as (s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots). It\u2019s important to note that the decision maker cannot influence the states of nature. The table that displays the payoffs for each combination of decision alternatives and states of nature is known as the payoff table. Click on each tab to explore the different decision-making approaches in detail. An optimist evaluates the best possible payoff that can occur and choose the decision alternative correspond to that payoff. The decision always correspond to maximum profit or minimum cost. Optimistic approach is also referred to as MaxMax approach. The decision alternative is d3, which is the maximum payoff in the table corresponding to state of nature s3. This approach evaluates each decision in terms of the worst payoff and the decision is to choose the best of the worst payoffs. For the situation mentioned above: This approach is also referred to as MaxMin approach, which takes the maximum of the minimum payoff from each decision alternative. This is neither optimistic nor conservative, but somewhere in the middle. In this case, we create a regret table, as follows. If the state of nature is s1, the best payoff will be 10 and if the decision was d1, then there is no regret. If the decision is d2, the regret is 2 (10-8), and if the decision is d3, the regret is 4 (10-6). If the state of nature is s2, the best payoff is 18 where the regret is 0, and the regret is 3 and 2 corresponding to d1 and d3, respectively. Thus we create the regret table from the payoff table. We calculate the maximum regret for each decision alternative and the decision is to minimize the maximum regret. In this case, we choose d3.

A few basic reminders for appropriate communication: *Subject to change Corporate finance deals with the management of a company\u2019s finances.\u00a0 When talking about a company, we restrict our attention to\u00a0publicly-traded corporations. There are three major decisions in corporate finance: An easy way to describe these decisions is to look at a representative (and simplified) balance sheet below. Capital investment decisions deal with the investments in long-lived assets (bottom left-hand side of the balance sheet labeled fixed assets).\u00a0 Capital budgeting is the term used to describe the process of making and managing such investments. Financing decisions deal with the middle and bottom parts of the right-hand side of the balance sheet.\u00a0 This part of the balance sheet is concerned with the firm\u2019s capital structure, namely the proportions of interest-bearing debt and equity used in the firm. The management of short-term liquidity or operating cash flows deals with the upper left-hand and upper right-hand sides of the balance sheet.\u00a0 In corporate finance, the management of short-term operating cash flows is associated with the firm\u2019s net working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities. To provide a real-world perspective, below is Home Depot\u2019s 2019 fiscal-year balance sheet taken from its\u00a02019 Annual Report\u00a0 (See\u00a0note) The job of a financial manager is to manage the three activities related to capital budgeting, capital structure, and short-term operating cash flows.\u00a0 The process to manage these activities can be described by the following figure. Imagine that the financial manager sits in the middle of the yellow and blue boxes.\u00a0 The firm starts by raising capital in the financial market (A) in the form of debt and equity.\u00a0 The capital raised in the form of debt and equity is reported on the right-hand side of the balance sheet.\u00a0 The company then invests that capital in productive assets (B) classified as current assets and fixed assets on the left-hand side of the firm\u2019s balance sheet.\u00a0 At the end of the operating period, the firm records its revenue, costs and expenses in its income statement and reports its cash flows in the statement of cash flows (C).\u00a0 Some of the cash generated goes to the government in the form of taxes (D), some is retained and plowed back into the business (E), and some goes to repayment of debt and dividend payments (F). Conducting the above activities requires the financial manager to make decisions that create value for the firm.\u00a0 Value is created when the firm\u2019s activity generates returns on capital that exceeds its costs.\u00a0 As you progress through the Master of Finance program, the definition of value creation (or destruction) will be operationalized in subsequent courses such as BUSAD826.\u00a0 When you reach the capstone course (BUSAD585), you should be able to identify firms that create or destroy value and understand the sources of value creation or destruction. For those with a business background, the earlier definition of value creation sounds like a measure of profit (or profitability) in accounting.\u00a0 While related, it goes beyond an accounting measure.\u00a0 In finance, cash flows are important.\u00a0 Because firms operate over multiple periods, the timing of revenue generation (and hence, the recognition of revenue and accounting profit) is not necessarily going to coincide with the timing of cash flows.\u00a0 Moreover, the magnitude of accounting profit is not the same as that of cash flows.\u00a0 Complicating matters further, the amount and timing of cash flows are not known with certainty.\u00a0 As such, financial managers need to\u00a0manage risk\u00a0as well. Financial decision making relies on the availability of data. Statistical methods provide powerful tools to analyze data and draw conclusions from them.\u00a0\u00a0 To make sense of financial data, we need the help of statistics. Statistical methods include descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. In this section, we will describe tools from descriptive statistics to help us understand the topic in the next section. In statistics, it is important to know the difference between populations and samples.\u00a0 A population is a group of all items of interest to the statisticians, while a sample is a subset of the population.\u00a0 A descriptive measure of a population is called a parameter, while a descriptive measure of a sample is called a statistic.\u00a0 In practice, it can be impractical and costly to get information about a population.\u00a0 That\u2019s why a sample is collected to characterize the population.\u00a0 For example, collecting the stock price performance of all large-capitalization stocks in the US (population) would be costly in terms of effort and cost, not to mention the potential error with data collection.\u00a0 Instead, we could use the performance of the S&P 500 index (sample) as a proxy. Descriptive Statistics Tools Select each heading below to read more about these descriptive statistics tools. One useful tool to visually describe historical data, e.g., monthly returns of Costco over the last 5 years, is frequency table and its corresponding histogram. Let\u2019s say you have downloaded the monthly returns data for Costco over the last 5 years. Constructing the\u00a0frequency table\u00a0and\u00a0histogram\u00a0is easily done in Excel. You are strongly encouraged to check Youtube videos, read Excel\u2019s help menu, or do a Google search for steps to construct a frequency table and histogram. Below is the distribution and histogram of Costco\u2019s monthly returns from August 2015 through July 2020. As the histogram shows, the most common monthly returns for Costco lie between 4.01% and 6.63% with 13 observations out of 60. While visual description of data above is useful, we often want to better quantify the characteristics of data. To do so, we calculate the\u00a0central tendency\u00a0of the data. The most frequently used central tendency measure is the mean (usually called the average). Other measures include the median and mode.\u00a0(Note about other measures) The mean of a variable of interest in a data set is computed by adding all the values associated with that particular variable in the data set divided by the number of values for that variable in the data set. The population mean is computed as \u03bc = \u03a3i=1N Xi / N where N is the number of observations in the entire population and Xi is the ith observation. While the sample mean is calculated as \u0305X = \u03a3i=1n Xi / n where n is the number of observations in the sample. The median is the middle value of a variable of interest in the data set.\u00a0 The median is found by locating the middle value of observations in a data set that have been sorted into ascending (or descending) order. In an odd-numbered sample of\u00a0n\u00a0items, the median occupies the (n\u00a0+ 1)/2 position. In an even-numbered sample, the median is defined as the average value of items occupying the\u00a0n/2 and (n\u00a0+ 2)/2 positions (namely, the average of the two middle items). The mode is the most frequently occurring value for a variable of interest in a data set.\u00a0 A distribution can have more than one mode or even no mode.\u00a0 A distribution with two modes is called\u00a0bimodal; a distribution with three modes is called\u00a0trimodal. Note: Like the mean, we can distinguish between a population median and a sample median as well as between a population mode and a sample mode.\u00a0 The term median and mode are used here without qualification in the interest of brevity. Below is an example of computing the mean, median, and mode in Excel.\u00a0 There are 17 observations in the hypothetical sample data set, identified in column A.\u00a0 Column B contains the variable of interest. In practice, median is sometimes a better measure of central tendency than the mean because the median is more robust against outliers and when the distribution is skewed. To better quantify the characteristics of data, it is also useful to have\u00a0measures of dispersion. Dispersion is defined as variability around the central tendency.\u00a0 Common measures of dispersion are range, mean absolute deviation, variance, and standard deviation. All of these are measures of absolute dispersion, namely, the amount of variability without comparison to a reference point or benchmark. Range is the simplest measure of dispersion, and is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set\u00a0(Note about range). \u00a0 Rather than using only the maximum and minimum values in the data set to measure dispersion, we can use all observations. In this case, we can measure the deviation from the mean for each observation. Then, we could compute the arithmetic mean of the deviation from the mean. However, we have a problem: the deviation from the mean always sum to 0, so the average of the deviations from the mean would be 0 as well.This result occurs because the negative deviations cancel out the positive deviations. To address this issue, we take the absolute deviation from the mean for each observation in the data set. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) for a sample is computed as: MAD = \u03a3i=1n |Xi \u2013 \u0305X| / n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Equation (4) \u0305X is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample. Below is an example of range and mean absolute deviation in Excel. Cells G6-G8 show the calculations of minimum value, maximum value, and range.\u00a0 Column C shows the deviation from the mean for each observation.\u00a0 Note that the average of deviation from the mean (cell C22) is 0 because the sum of values in cells C4 to C20 is 0.\u00a0 Column D contains the absolute deviation from the mean.\u00a0 Note that each entry in cells D4 to D20 takes the absolute value of the corresponding entries in cells C4 to C20.\u00a0 As shown in cell D22, the MAD is 4.47059. Instead of taking the absolute value of deviations from the mean, we can take the square of the deviations from the mean to measure dispersion.\u00a0 The variance and standard deviation, which are based on squaring the deviations from the mean, are the two most commonly used measure of dispersion.\u00a0 The variance is defined as the average of the squared deviations around the mean.\u00a0 Standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance.\u00a0 In finance, variance and standard deviation are the most practical and widely used measure of dispersion, often used to assess the level of risk in an investment.\u00a0 The greater the standard deviation of investment returns, the higher the risk of the investment. Like the mean, we can distinguish population and sample variance and standard deviation.\u00a0 The formulas are given below. Population variance: \u03c32 = \u03a3i=1N ( Xi \u2013 \u03bc )2 / N \u00a0\u00a0\nSample variance: s2 = \u03a3i=1n ( Xi \u2013 \u0305X )2 / (n \u2013 1) \u00a0\nEquation (5) where \u03bc is the population mean, \u0305X is the sample mean, N is the population size, and n is the sample size. Note from equations (5) and (6) that the variance and standard deviation are greater when the squared deviations from the mean are greater (namely, more variability around the mean).\u00a0 Because variance is expressed in squared units of measurement, it is often more appealing to use the standard deviation, which is measured in the original unit of measurement. It is also important to note that the denominator in the sample variance or standard deviation calculation is\u00a0n-1, not\u00a0n.\u00a0 The quantity\u00a0n-1 is known as the degrees of freedom in estimating the population variance.\u00a0 To calculate sample variance or standard deviation in a sample data set with\u00a0n\u00a0observations, we must first compute the sample mean.\u00a0 Once the sample mean has been computed, there are only\u00a0n-1 independent deviations from it. Using the previous hypothetical sample data set, the calculations of sample variance and standard deviation are given below. Sample variance is shown in cells D22 and D23.\u00a0 Cell D22 uses equation (5) for sample variance, while cell D23 uses Excel\u2019s built-in sample variance formula (VAR.S).\u00a0 As shown, the results are identical.\u00a0 Similarly, the sample standard deviation calculation in cell D25 uses equation (6) for sample standard deviation. \u00a0Cell D26 shows the calculation of sample standard deviation using Excel\u2019s built-in function (STDEV.S).\u00a0 The results are identical. The MM Dividend Irrelevance Theory is useful as a benchmark case to think about factors that are likely to matter in the real world.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now consider a few real-world market imperfections: (a) personal taxes, (b) agency costs, and (c) asymmetric information. Select each header below for information In the U.S., tax rate on dividend income is higher than it is on capital gains.\u00a0 For individual investors, the preferential tax treatment of capitals gains should affect their preference for dividend payments versus stock repurchases.\u00a0 For most individuals, capital gains are not taxed until they are realized.\u00a0 Moreover, the tax rate applied to realized long-term capital gains has been generally lower than the tax rate on dividend income.\u00a0 As rational investors can time the realization of capital gains, it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to be averse to dividend payments and prefer share repurchases for tax reasons. However, some rational investors may be in a high tax-bracket group, while others in a low tax-bracket group.\u00a0 Investors in the low tax-bracket are likely to prefer low- to medium-payout stocks, while those in the high tax-bracket are likely to prefer zero- to low-payout stocks.\u00a0 In addition, there are tax-free institutions and corporations that may have certain preferences regarding dividend payout.\u00a0 For example, although pension funds are exempt from taxes on dividends and capital gains, they may prefer dividends.\u00a0 Corporations can exclude at least 70% of their dividend income but cannot exclude any capital gains.\u00a0 So, corporations are likely to prefer high dividend-paying stocks even if they have no need for dividend income. Managers are hired to serve the best interest of the company\u2019s shareholders.\u00a0 When there is a conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, managers may make a decision in the shareholders\u2019 best interest. In other situations, however, managers may pursue their own selfish interest at the expense of shareholders.\u00a0 For example, managers may find it easier to pursue their selfish goals when the company has a lot of free cash flow.\u00a0 Scholars have suggested that the board of directors can use dividend policy to reduce the agency costs of free cash flow.\u00a0 By using the surplus cash flow (in excess of that needed to fund positive NPV projects) to pay dividends or buy back shares, the management\u2019s ability to waste corporate resources can be restricted. Empirical studies have documented positive stock price reaction in response to dividend increases and negative stock price reaction in response to dividend cuts.\u00a0 Surveys have also reported that management is reluctant to cut dividends and has a priority to maintain a consistent dividend policy.\u00a0 Since managers have better knowledge about the company than do outsiders, rational investors will reason that dividend increases are good news and dividend cuts are bad news.\u00a0 Given the management priority to maintain consistent dividend policy and reluctance to cut dividends, it\u2019s reasonable to argue that management will not increase the level of dividends if it is not confident that the new dividend level can be maintained in the future. Hence, the\u00a0increase\u00a0in dividends is interpreted as a signal of the management\u2019s optimism in the company\u2019s future prospects.\u00a0 A dividend\u00a0reduction\u00a0signals management\u2019s beliefs that bad times are coming.

For a good part of that time, we\u2019ve used business intelligence, which is an umbrella term describing a family of business analysis techniques ranging from standard reports to highly sophisticated advanced statistics.\u00a0Recently we\u2019ve heard terms like Big Data and cognitive business. As we look at this closer, we realize that this terminology is still the same thing as what BI (Business Intelligence) has been trying to do all along \u2013 looking at and analyzing vast amounts of data that we generate and then look at how we can improve top and bottom lines and be competitive. So no matter what we call it, Big Data, BI, cognitive business, or even data mining, the challenge that businesses are facing is realizing the value of information that they have.Therefore we need to look at helping business executives, managers and analysts sort through this confusing array of terminology to understand what is real, what is hype and how to leverage this data to improve the top or bottom line or both. We also need to ensure that we have alignment between business strategies and to help manage the complex organizational factors that determine how BI applications are developed and affectively they are adopted within these business processes to increase the top or bottom line or both.So as we should define some of these are the terms: (Click the tabs to learn more) Business intelligence (BI)\u00a0is an umbrella term that combines architectures, tools, databases, analytical tools, applications, scorecards, dashboards, and methodologies to increase the top or bottom line or both. Analytics\u00a0is a subset of business intelligence and an umbrella term that encompasses provision of relevant statistical analyses,\u00a0forecasts,\u00a0models and/or simulations to business users for use in increasing increase the top or bottom line or both. Big Data\u00a0is large amounts of rapidly generated pictures,\u00a0video clips,\u00a0geospatial data, sensor data, text messages, document images, weblogs, and machine data captured in use by social media and Internet based businesses. Big Data Analytics\u00a0is the analysis of stored Big Data content of various kinds to supplement your BI and traditional analytics for use in increasing the top or bottom line or both. Cognitive Business\u00a0is the use of structured and unstructured data and highly sophisticated analytical techniques to identify, evaluate and recommend businesses courses of actions. Data Warehouse\u00a0is a specialized database used to store important business information about transactions, products, customers, channels, financial results, performance metrics and other business information. Ultimately, all forms of BI deliver business information for decision-makers to use to analyze past performance and it\u2019s root causes, model and analyze various courses of action, predict future results and analyze economic impacts and make decisions that are formed by underlying data and sound analytical techniques. The amount of information of social media is getting larger and larger every day and if the airlines can utilize their resources reasonably, they can provide better services to the passengers, retain old customers and develop new customers. Currently we have three primary models for evaluating the social media customer value: Weibo data mining (is a Chinese microblogging website. Akin to a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook.) Klout Scoring Klout scores website users based on a set of data mining algorithms and according to the indexes such as if a user has social media accounts or not, his/her number of fans, his/her update frequency, if his/her content is praised by others, his/her number of comments, his/her number forwarding, etc.\u00a0Klout score social media users with 100 as the standard.\u00a0Its specific scoring mode is:\u00a0if the customer has an account on Twitter or another social media website, and their messages can be seen by others, they were to get certain scores.\u00a0 Based on this, Klout will score you according to the index such as your number of fans, frequency of your information update, Klout scores of your friends and fans, number people who like your things, number replies, number of forwarding etc. The Klout scoring model has three main factors: Kred Scoring The main source of Kred is Twitter and it established a scoring model based on surrounding followers, likes or shares with others.\u00a0The final score consists of two parts: Influence score reflects the breadth of the user\u2019s influence and the external connection score reflects the influence depth.\u00a0The influence score measures the ability of a user to motivate others from 1 to 1000, which depends on the number of the user\u2019s Twitter messages forwarded, the number of new followers and the number of replies of the user. The main difference between Kred and Klout is that the transparency of Kred is comparatively high which will display how a user gets the final score, even the value of a specific forwarding. Weibo Data Mining The user scoring of micro data mainly inspects factors in three aspects: Influence = activity + spreading capacity + reach Activity\u00a0refers to the number of valid posts of posting forwarding and commenting Weibos. Spreading capacity\u00a0refers to the number of valid posts and a number valid people forwarding and commenting posts. Reach\u00a0refers to the number of active fans. As these examples show, an impact of Big Data is that actions have greater consequences, at a more accelerated pace and direct repercussions for company\u2019s brand quality, customer relationships and revenue. For both individuals and organizations, there are\u00a04 common elements\u00a0of what can be considered a framework for Big Data ethics: What is the relationship between our off-line and our on-line identity? Who should control access to data? Who owns data? Can rights to it be transferred? What are the obligations of people who generate and use that data? How can we determine what data is trustworthy, whether about ourselves, others or anything else? Big Data exponentially increases the amount of information ways we can interact with it.\u00a0This phenomenon increases the complexity of managing how we are perceived and judged. Both individuals and organizations have legitimate interests in understanding how data is being handled, which means this has the potential to inform both the benefits Big Data provides and the potential risks from unintended consequences for a truly staggering number of people.\u00a0The direct impact of failing to understand the complexities and nuance of the relationships between Big Data technologies and the people who use them could lead to dire consequences. You may be asking why not just any data.\u00a0Big Data is data too big to be handled by traditional database protocols.\u00a0In this sense, size is just one aspect of these new technologies.\u00a0The risk and ethical considerations also come from a few related factors. Volume, variety and velocity of available information exponentially increases the complexity of information that companies need to manage, and these factors generate questions that haven\u2019t been previously encountered in the course of doing business.\u00a0The volume which new data is being generated is staggering.\u00a0We live in an age where the amount of data we expect to be generated is measured in exabytes and zettabytes.\u00a0By the year 2025, the forecast is that the Internet will exceed the brain capacity of everyone living on the entire planet. While business innovators are excited about the potential benefits they can create from the design and development of a wide range of new products and services based on Big Data technologies, the size, variety and velocity of information available raises new questions.\u00a0Some of these questions are about the implications of the acquisition, storage and use of large quantities of data about people\u2019s attributes, behavior, preferences, relationships and locations. Fundamentally these questions are ethical. They relate to your values and how we play them while creating products and services.Society, government and the legal system have not yet adapted to the coming age of Big Data impacts such as transparency, correlation and aggregation.\u00a0There was a time when it could be fairly easy to drop \u2018off the grid\u2019 and disappear within the continental United States.\u00a0Today, it would be nearly impossible for a person to do much of anything without generating a data trail that a reasonably knowledgeable and modestly equipped investigator could follow to its end.

Navigating This Course Ideally, you should complete each lesson\u2019s activities in the following order: A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment. Students are encouraged to seek the instructor\u2019s input during the process of completing each course requirement. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments. **Grades will be based on the following scale: A = 93 \u2013 100, A- = 90 \u2013 92, B+ = 87 \u2013 89, B = 84 \u2013 86, B- = 80 \u2013 83, C+ = 77 \u2013 79, C = 70 \u2013 76, D = 60 \u2013 69, and F = 60 and below. Note:\u00a0A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin). The following grading system applies to graduate students: \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) indicates exceptional achievement.\u201cB\u201d (Good) indicates substantial achievement.\u201cC\u201d (Satisfactory) indicates acceptable but substandard achievement; and\u201cD\u201d (Poor) indicates inadequate achievement and is a failing grade for a graduate student. Students are reminded that simply meeting the minimal requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content and presentation) will result in a letter grade of \u201cB\u201d or less for that assignment. Within 7 days after you have submitted an assignment, you will be able to review your grade and any comments made by your instructor. This process is used for all homework assignments, exams, or other graded submissions. Some instructors may also send you a message informing you that the assignment has been graded. Some instructors may choose to release all the grades to all students at once; other instructors may release grades per student one at a time. To view your grades, go to\u00a0Grades\u00a0in the\u00a0Course Navigation Menu. There will be (6) discussion boards for students to discuss different aspects of the course.

If your upcoming work or personal schedule may prevent you from submitting your assignment on time, I highly recommend that you attempt to submit the assignment earlier and not later. A few basic reminders: *Subject to change Even if, for the MER mission, data communication was in batches due to the extreme conditions in which it happens with technology advances, communication will converge more and more towards real-time transmission.\u00a0If you look around, there are many use cases where real-time data generation and consumption is feasible. There are many systems around us that are better understood and managed as a continuous stream of events, such as system normal operation heartbeats, ocean currents, machine metrics, autonomous vehicles, GPS signals. Collecting and analyzing this information as a real-time stream of data can help increase the quality of response of systems to unexpected events or to system needs. Real-Time Systems for Data Streaming Data streaming is a technique transferring data between two computers in a steady and continuous stream. Typically, streaming technologies are fashioned on a client-server model. For this whole process to work properly, the client must receive the data from the server and pass it to the streaming application for processing. The streaming application converts\u202faccording to\u202fthe rules\u202fsystem designed principles. An important factor in the success of this process is the ability of the client to receive data faster\u202fthan the rate to which it is transited by the server as well as the rate at which it\u202fcan display the information. Definition of a Real-Time System According to Stankovic, real-time systems are the subset of systems in which the correctness of the system depends not only on the logical result of computation, but also on the time at which the results are produced. A real time system is NOT a system that runs quickly but rather it is a system that has temporal constraints to meet. Batch Versus Streaming In the past,\u00a0to\u00a0handle data analysis at scale, data was collected and analyzed in batch.\u202fFor example, in the previous class we used to process data at one\u202fdays\u202fintervals. For each interval we would process a rather large batch of data. This data processing model is not appropriate for some applications such as Internet of Things (IoT). For example, a temperature sensor, powered by just 2 batteries, can have an operational lifetime of 500,000 wireless transmissions and can have a 0-year battery life.\u202fIf this data is transmitted only daily in batches, it will have less relevance for some tasks such as overheat protection of a device or tool. In\u202fgeneral, batch processing is a good way to deal with huge amounts of distributed data,\u202flike in the example of a data warehouse or the HDFS/map-reduce framework. If the system requires\u202fan hourly summation of a series of events and an end-of-day or weekly final sum, batch processes may\u202fbe a good architecture. But for many use cases, batch does not sufficiently reflect the\u202fchanges\u00a0in\u202finformation as needed.\u202fIn cases like\u202ftemperature monitoring, the benefits of adopting a streaming style of handling data go\u202fmuch\u202ffarther\u202fbeyond the\u202fcapabilities of a batch system.\u202fData that was streamed through a real-time system\u202fdoes not need to be discarded.\u202fIt can be stored in a raw format for further/different processing as\u202fdata persistence pays off in a variety of ways.

The most important property of a real-time system is its predictability.\u202fPredictability\u202fin real-time systems has two components: For example,\u00a0assuming that\u00a0we develop a large and complex real-time system. For each of the subsystems we must identify\u202fcritical and non-critical constrains and how the related tasks should be addressed on a scale from hard to soft real-time tasks.\u202f\u202fIn the end,\u202fall\u202fthe\u202fdimensions of\u202fa\u202freal-time systems\u202fcontribute to the outcome of the process\u202fsimultaneously\u202fand they\u00a0have to\u00a0work harmoniously to achieve the system goal.\u202fIf designers cannot focus on just one predominant feature of the system such as\u202fcritical\u202fconstraints\u202fthe real-time system is likely to fail. In such complex systems\u202fit is difficult to define and demonstrate predictability.\u202fAt high data input rate, it is difficult to\u202fensure\u202fa 100%\u202fpredictability\u202fguarantee\u202fand it is likely that this guaranty must be relaxed.\u202f\u202fIn general,\u202freal-time systems need to declare guaranty to which the system\u202frequirements\u00a0are met.\u202fAt the system level\u202flevel\u202fwe need to show first that all critical tasks will always make their deadline (100% guarantee) and that all non-critical tasks meet overall requirements. As an example, these overall requirements might be stated in the following way: 97% of noncritical hard real-time tasks, and 95 % of soft real-time tasks must make their deadlines. Cassandra supports a per-operation tradeoff between consistency and availability through a set of\u00a0consistency levels.\u00a0The following consistency levels are available in Table 8.1. It is common to pick read and write consistency levels such that the replica sets overlap, resulting in all acknowledged writes being visible to subsequent reads. For example,\u00a0for a replication factor of three, a\u00a0QUORUM\u00a0request will require responses from at least\u00a02/3\u00a0replicas. If\u00a0QUORUM\u00a0is used for both writes and reads, at least one of the replicas is guaranteed to participate in\u00a0both\u00a0the write and the read request, which in turn guarantees that the quorums will\u00a0overlap\u00a0and the write will be visible to the read. In a multi-datacenter environment,\u00a0LOCAL_QUORUM\u00a0can be used to provide a weaker but still useful guarantee: reads are guaranteed to see the latest write from within the same datacenter. This is often sufficient as clients homed to a single datacenter will read their own writes. Kafka is an open-source high-performance, distributed, durable, fault-tolerant, publish-subscribe messaging system.\u202fKafka was created at LinkedIn\u202fin\u202f2010 to track various events, such as page views, messages from the messaging system, and logs from various services.\u202fMore recently, it is used for moving messages streams\u202fin a real-time system. With Kafka, one can collect data streams for processing\u202fand storage in other components of the real-time system.\u202fKafka uses the publish/subscribe messaging model. In this model, subscribers can register for news in\u00a0several\u00a0topics they are interested in and they are eventually notified by news in news in those topics in an asynchronous mode. (SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE) In a\u202fpublish-subscribe\u202fmessaging system, systems called\u202fpublishers\u202fsend streams of messages.\u202fIn general, the set of publishers of the messages are called\u202fproducers, since they produce\u202fthe input\u202fmessages. Another set of systems,\u00a0called\u202fsubscribers,\u202fare waiting for new messages of interest to be produced and they\u202fread those messages.\u202fIn general, the set of all the subscribers are called\u202fconsumers, since they consume the\u202fpublished\u202fmessages. A\u202fpublish-subscribe\u202fmessaging system, known as a\u202fmessage broker,\u202fmoves\u202fdata streams between applications\u202fand provides\u202fa\u202floose coupling\u202fbetween publishers and subscribers, or producers and consumers of data.\u202fThe message broker stores published messages in a queue and subscribers read them from the queue. Hence, subscribers and publishers do not have to be synchronized. This loose coupling allows subscribers and publishers to read and write at different rates. The ability of the messaging system to store messages provides fault tolerance so messages don\u2019t get lost between the time they are produced and the time they are consumed. Figure 11.2\u00a0shows such a publish-subscribe messaging system. This system has two producers and three subscribers.\u00a0The two producers\u00a0generated\u00a0a number of\u00a0six messages, which are in different stages of processing. Message 1 is sent to the consumers for further processing, messages 2 to 4 are waiting in a queue to be sent to the consumers as soon as they become available, while messages 5 and 6 are waiting to be queued by the messaging queue. Streaming environments can have a wide variety of configurations.\u202fFor instance,\u202fthe messages can have different purposes based on their data content. These streamed messages can be grouped by their purpose or characteristics. Such groups are called\u202ftopics. Consumers subscribe to topics to receive messages produced for that topic.\u202fThe example in the figure below, shows a message que that contains two topics called \u201cTopic 1\u201d and \u201cTopic 2\u201d. For example, Topic 1 can queue information about sensor temperature while \u201cTopic 2\u201d about server logs. Messages related to each topic can be produced by multiple consumers. For example, in\u00a0Figure 11.3, both producers generate messages relevant to both topics while, Producer 2 generates messages that are relevant only to Topic 2.\u202fA topic can be thought of as a feed of related data. Each message\u202fmust be\u202fassociated with a topic\u202fwhile a\u202ftopic can have zero, one, or many subscribers\u202fthat read data from it. Kafka supports a publish-subscribe model that handles multiple message streams. These message streams are stored as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue in a fault-tolerant manner. Processes can read messages from streams at any time. Each topic is managed as a\u202fpartitioned log. In Kafka, a log is an ordered queue of message records. A partitioned log is a log that is broken up into multiple smaller logs, each of which is called a\u202fpartition.\u202fA\u202fpartition\u202fis an ordered, immutable sequence of messages that is continually appended to. Each message contains a\u202fsequential ID number called the offset that uniquely identifies the message in the partition.\u202fMessage ordering in Kafka is per partition only.\u00a0Figure 11.4\u00a0shows an\u00a0example partition for Topic\u202f2. This topic is spread across two nodes/servers. Messages are consumed from the earliest to the latest using a queue model. Partitions allow the log to\u202fscale\u202fbeyond a single server. Each partition must fit on one of the servers that hosts it \u2026 but a topic can have multiple partitions and therefore handle an arbitrary amount of data. Each server manages a set of partitions belonging to different topics.\u202fEach topic can have one or more partitions. The size (in terms of messages stored) of partitions is limited to what can fit on a single node/server. If you have more data in a topic than can fit on a single node you must increase the number of partitions. Partitions are spread across the nodes in a Kafka cluster. Partitions can have copies to increase durability and availability.\u202f This is called the Replication Factor and can be 1 or more. In Kafka, all messages in the log are durable, meaning they are written to disk. The messages persist for a configurable\u00a0time period. After that time, they are discarded. Partitions can be replicated onto multiple servers for fault tolerance.\u202fEach partition has one server that is elected to be the\u202fleader\u202ffor that partition. There can be zero or more other servers that are followers for that partition. The amount of replication\u202fcan be configured at the setup of the cluster. The leader handles all read/write requests for the partition and is responsible for replicating messages to its followers. Only the leader communicates with clients. If the leader fails, one of the followers gets elected to be the new leader. Partitions allow the log to\u202fscale\u202fbeyond a single server. Each partition must fit on one of the servers that hosts it \u2026 but a topic can have multiple partitions and therefore handle an arbitrary amount of data. Each server manages a set of partitions belonging to different topics.\u202fEach topic can have one or more partitions. The size (in terms of messages stored) of partitions is limited to what can fit on a single node/server. If you have more data in a topic than can fit on a single node you must increase the number of partitions. Partitions are spread across the nodes in a Kafka cluster. Partitions can have copies to increase durability and availability.\u202f This is called the Replication Factor and can be 1 or more. Kafka is designed to be highly scalable. This means\u202fthat Kafka\u00a0can\u00a0handle an increase in the volume of incoming messages from producers.\u202fAn increase in the number of producers can lead to cluster load and imbalance. To balance the cluster, all the nodes should have similar load. In Kafka, each publisher process is responsible for choosing which message goes to which partition. The default\u202ffor determining the partition is the\u202fround-robin distribution\u202falgorithm. Alternatively, programmers have the option to define their own partitioning function if they want to direct specific data within a topic to a certain partition.\u202fMore partitions in a topic allows a message stream to be distributed among more severs, enabling the cluster to sustain a heavier load of incoming data. Another component of scalability is that\u202fKafka\u00a0can\u00a0store large queues of messages. The ability to handle queues is addressed by breaking a topic into multiple partitions. A partition is limited to a single\u00a0broker,\u00a0but many partitions can be managed my many systems. Finally, Kafka allows\u202fconsumers to grow to handle an increase in the volume or the processing complexity of messages.\u202fIn Kafka, a\u202fconsumer process is part of a\u202fconsumer group. A consumer group may have one or more consumers within it.\u202fThis allows you to distribute the processing of messages among multiple consumers. Each member of the consumer group gets a fair share of partitions for its subscribed topic. Kafka relies on Apache Zookeeper for getting heartbeats from brokers, leader election, replication settings, and tracking the members of the cluster.\u202fZooKeeper\u202fis a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.\u00a0All\u00a0these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications.\u202fProducers contact Zookeeper to find partitions. Consumers contact Zookeeper to track the current index number of the next message in each partition. The DAAN 826 course explores fundamental and emerging concepts in real-time big data processing.

Understanding large-scale databases for real-time analytics equips students with in-demand skills for careers in data engineering, big data analysis, and real-time data processing. Proficiency in technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, and MongoDB, combined with knowledge of real-time reporting and data streaming, positions students for roles in industries such as finance, healthcare, IoT, e-commerce, and technology. Employers value expertise in designing, implementing, and managing scalable database solutions, as well as analyzing live data streams to support decision-making processes. By mastering these tools and concepts, students will have the competitive edge to pursue careers as data engineers, database administrators, data analysts, or big data architects, working on innovative solutions for real-time challenges. One real-world example of large-scale databases for real-time analytics is fraud detection in the financial services industry. Financial institutions process millions of transactions every second, and using real-time analytics powered by databases like Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka, they can identify fraudulent activities as they happen. For instance, a sudden pattern of transactions originating from different geographic locations within a short period may trigger fraud detection algorithms to flag the transactions. Using real-time streaming data, these systems can analyze transaction behavior patterns, detect anomalies, and alert users or financial institutions instantly to prevent financial loss. This approach depends on processing large-scale data streams quickly, highlighting the real-world application of real-time analytics for decision-making and risk management. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Course Requirements and Grading Unlocking Your Potential Honorlock Proctoring Lesson 14: Example Reporting of Real-Time DataHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsThe course starts with an overview of the paradigm for big data which includes an explanation of issues with traditional databases and the properties/limitations of big data systems.\n\nThe first topic\u00a0is\u00a0storage in the batch layer.

For example, the house price prediction is a regression problem in which the house purchase price (dependent variable) can be estimated from predictors or variables such as the number of bedrooms, the lot size, and location etc. The overall idea of regression is to examine which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable. Neural networks\u00a0can be seen as natural extension of\u00a0linear regression. The characteristics of the biological neuron: Recall the comparison we made in Lesson 1 between the\u00a0biological neuron\u00a0and the\u00a0artificial neuron. Implementing Blocks From an implementation perspective, a block is a Python class, which inherits from the tf.keras.Model that presents a block in Keras. A customized block class has the constructor function__init__(self) to perform the necessary initialization and the call()to define the forward propagation of the block, that is, how to obtain the required output based on the input. The block class must thus define the forward propagation function call()and must store any required weights and biases. It is worth noting that the block does not need to define the backpropagation function to compute the gradients. In fact, the block class will inherit the auto differentiation function from its parent (tf.keras.Model). You only need to define the code for the forward propagation function and manage the weights and biases (model parameters) if required by your customized block. The following snippet implements a MLP model with one fully-connected hidden layer with 256 units and ReLU activation, followed by a fully-connected output layer with 10 neuron units and no activation function.

As AI continues to evolve and expand, professionals equipped with deep learning knowledge are not only poised for rewarding careers but also positioned to lead the transformation of industries worldwide. One real-world example of a deep learning project addressing climate change challenges can be seen in the field of extreme weather prediction. A government agency wanted to implement a system to analyze vast amounts of climate data to predict hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves more accurately. However, the challenge lay in the complex nature of climate data, which spans across time and space, and in the lack of tools capable of integrating this data effectively. The initial attempts used traditional statistical models, which failed to capture the intricate patterns and interactions in the data. This resulted in inaccurate predictions, leading to insufficient preparedness for extreme weather events and significant economic and societal costs. To overcome these limitations, a team of deep learning researchers and data scientists was brought in to develop a robust solution. They used advanced time series forecasting and spatiotemporal data analysis techniques to train neural networks capable of understanding the complex relationships in the data. The team leveraged convolutional and recurrent neural networks to process spatial and temporal aspects of the climate data and incorporated visualization tools to make predictions accessible to policymakers. By applying these models, they created a system that could accurately predict weather patterns, giving communities and governments weeks of advance warning. This implementation not only improved disaster preparedness but also provided insights into long-term climate trends, enabling better resource allocation and planning. The success of this project highlighted the transformative potential of deep learning in addressing pressing global issues like climate change. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 14: Project Presentation and Evaluation Unlocking Your Potential Optional Software Assignment DetailsHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsStudents must be in the AI_MPS or DAAN_MPS majors.

The training dataset has input features and their corresponding output labels. Once the model is trained, the test cases with input features are provided to the model on which the model predicts the output labels. A number of interesting issues arise when the planning is done on-line while interacting with the environment. Additional information that is gained from the interaction may result in changing the model and also the planning process. Therefore, it is desirable to customize the planning process. This means that there is a need to customize the states or decisions that are currently under consideration or expected in the near future. If both the decision-making and the model-learning are computationally intensive processes, then there is a need for the limited computational resources to be shared equally between them. In order to explore this issue this lesson discusses bout the Dyna-Q, a simple architecture that integrates the major functions needed for an on-line planning agent. All the functions of the Dyna-Q are simple and almost trivial. This lesson will highlight some of the alternative ways of achieving each function and the trade-offs between them.

Completing AI 572: Reinforcement Learning equips students with highly sought-after skills in one of the most advanced and dynamic areas of artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) underpins breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous systems, game AI, and personalized recommendations, making it a cornerstone of innovation in both academia and industry. The course prepares graduates to design, train, and implement RL algorithms, enabling machines to learn from interaction and improve performance over time, which is critical for solving complex real-world problems. Graduates of AI 572 can pursue roles such as Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Robotics Engineer, AI Research Scientist, and more. Industries like healthcare, finance, gaming, and autonomous vehicles actively seek professionals skilled in RL to build cutting-edge technologies. With the hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge gained in this course, students are well-positioned to make significant contributions to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. One real-world example of a reinforcement learning problem can be found in the autonomous vehicle industry. A company developing self-driving cars needed an algorithm to navigate complex urban environments, including recognizing traffic signals, avoiding obstacles, and making decisions at intersections. Initially, the system relied on traditional rule-based approaches, but these proved inadequate for handling dynamic scenarios, such as unpredictable pedestrian behavior or varying traffic conditions. As a result, the self-driving cars struggled to operate reliably in real-world conditions, leading to safety concerns and delays in deployment. To address this, reinforcement learning (RL) was implemented to train the self-driving system. Using a simulation environment, the RL algorithm was trained to optimize driving decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards for safe and efficient navigation and penalties for collisions or traffic violations. The system learned to adapt to complex situations by simulating millions of driving scenarios, including rare events like sudden lane changes or emergency braking. Once deployed, the RL-trained system demonstrated significant improvements in decision-making, enabling the autonomous vehicle to safely navigate busy urban areas with enhanced efficiency. This example highlights the transformative potential of reinforcement learning in addressing real-world challenges, ensuring safer and smarter autonomous systems. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 14: Final Lesson and Project Completion Unlocking Your Potential ***You should already have some knowledge of statistics (STAT 500 or equivalent) as well as experience with multivariate derivatives, matrices, vector operations, and preliminary programming skills in Python.

The first of which will be howto deal with bimodal data. Let\u2019s take a simple example to show how bimodal distributed data looks and how to transform a variable from a bimodaldistribution to a normal distribution. # Create a variable with bimodal distributionx = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)y = rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 2)bimodal =c(x,y) # bimodal is a variable with Bimodal distributionhist(bimodal) An outlier is a value or an observation that is distant from other observations, that is to say, a data point that differs significantly from other data points. Enderlein (1987) goes even further as the author considers outliers as values that deviate so much from other observations one might suppose a different underlying sampling mechanism. A boxplot helps to visualize a quantitative variable by displaying five common location summary(minimum, median, first and third quartiles and maximum) and any observation that was classified as asuspected outlier using the 1 replyinterquartile range (IQR)\u00a0criterion. Another method, known as Hampel filter, consists of considering as outliers the values outside the interval( ) formed by the median, plus or minus 3 median absolute deviations ( ):where is the median absolute deviation and is defined as the median of the absolute deviations. Similar to the Grubbs test, Dixon test is used to test whether a single low or high value is an outlier. So if more than one outliers is suspected, the test has to be performed on these suspected outliers individually. To perform the Dixon\u2019s test in R, we use the dixon.test() function from the {outliers} package.However, we\u00a0restrict our dataset\u00a0to the 20 first observations as the Dixon test can only be done on smallsample size (R will throw an error and accepts only dataset of 3 to 30 observations):subdat <- dat[1:20, ] test <- dixon.test(subdat$hwy) test## ## Dixon test for outliers## ## data: subdat$hwy## Q = 0.57143, p-value = 0.006508## alternative hypothesis: lowest value 15 is an outlier on August 17, 2020 09:27:12:\u201dComment written by The results show that the lowest value 15 is an outlier (p-value = 0.007). Confusion matrix: This is the matrix of the actual versus the predicted. Some terms used in a confusion matrix are: True positives (TPs): True positives are cases when we predict the disease as yes when thepatient actually does have the disease.True negatives (TNs): Cases when we predict the disease as no when the patient actually doesnot have the disease.False positives (FPs): When we predict the disease as yes when the patient actually does nothave the disease. FPs are also considered to be type I errors.False negatives (FNs): When we predict the disease as no when the patient actually does havethe disease. FNs are also considered to be type II errors. Precision (P): When yes is predicted, how often is it correct?(TP/TP+FP) Recall (R)/sensitivity/true positive rate: Among the actual yeses, what fraction was predictedas yes?(TP/TP+FN) F1 score (F1): This is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.

One practical example of a project in the field of Analytics Design Implementation, specifically within Supply Chain Optimization, can be illustrated by a manufacturing company seeking to enhance operational efficiencies and cost management. The company faced challenges with high operational costs due to inefficient inventory management and delayed product deliveries, which in turn led to stockouts and excess inventory in various segments of their supply chain. To address these issues, the company implemented a project focusing on the integration of predictive analytics and real-time data tracking systems. Initially, a team of analysts used predictive analytics to accurately forecast demand patterns and optimize inventory levels across different warehouses and retail outlets. This involved analyzing historical sales data, seasonal trends, and real-time market conditions to predict future product demands with high accuracy. Simultaneously, the company introduced real-time tracking systems for monitoring goods and materials throughout the supply chain. This technology provided dynamic updates on the location and status of goods, enabling more responsive logistics decisions. By implementing these systems, the company could significantly reduce delivery times and prevent situations of overstock and stockouts. The culmination of these efforts led to a streamlined supply chain operation with reduced operational costs, improved delivery performance, and an overall enhancement in customer satisfaction. This project not only demonstrated the power of integrating advanced analytics into supply chain management but also highlighted the tangible benefits such as cost savings and improved operational efficiency that can be achieved through such implementations. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Linear Regression Unlocking Your Potential Confusion MatrixHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsDraw upon previous Descriptive/Predictive/Prescriptive Analytics methods to complete a comprehensive project.

The following criteria will be used to evaluate student participation: *subject to change Rather than adopt a \u201cwe will know it when we see it\u201d approach, companies should apply a set of predetermined criteria to potential acquisition targets (however these targets are developed). A range of both financial and strategic criteria will filter out inappropriate acquisitions and minimize wasted efforts while focusing management attention and resources on opportunities that make sense. Evaluations can include both financial and business considerations. Let\u2019s examine each of these now. These criteria should be ranked in terms of importance and weighted relative to one another.\u00a0For a distribution business, the location of facilities, rather than management capability, may be most important, especially if there are plans to reduce management ranks at the target company post-transaction. Developing a useful set of criteria with some relative ranking and weighting is a useful first step in analyzing whether or not an acquisition is a favorable strategic fit. There are a wide range of major causes of M&A failure. Discussions with acquirers post-transaction, evaluations by academics and consultants studying M&A, and my own experiences reveal a long list of sources of deal failure. Interestingly, many mistakes are made or opportunities for identifying risk are missed in the due diligence phase of a transaction. Overvaluing of synergies, overlooking major target problems, and having difficulty integrating are symptomatic of due diligence failures. Table 5.1 identifies the major sources of deal failure in relation to each stage of a transaction. What is proper due diligence, and how can it be executed? The key focus needs to be on those issues that have the greatest effect on the ultimate success of the acquired company. The following six factors matter in an acquisition: Due diligence needs to be based on validating and verifying assumptions and beliefs associated with these factors while identifying risks that threaten the ultimate success of the transaction. At its most critical, due diligence focuses on answering these questions: We will focus on EV/revenue, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, and P/E. Keep in mind that certain industries utilize different metrics; we will review some specific examples at the end of lesson. Acquisition multiples reflect the control premium typically required in change-of-control transactions. Acquisition multiples may or may not reflect the potential synergies that the acquirer hopes to realize post-close. The level to which a transaction would include potential synergies is dependent on the level of competition for the target acquisition. The greater the competition and the more aggressive the bidding, the more potential synergies to be shared with the target\u2019s shareholders. The bottom line is that precedent transaction analyses are similar to comparable public companies analyses, but with a different perspective. While precedent transaction analyses also focus on comparing a relative valuation metric to a target acquisition, the basis for comparison is actual purchases rather than public market multiples. One main thesis of this type of analysis is that similar companies are purchased based on similar multiples; these multiples can be applied to a privately held or publicly traded company in order to imply a comparable value. As a valuation tool, precedent transactions supplement other valuation methodologies to answer the following kinds of questions: Transaction valuation analysis is not a science; valuing a company is difficult and can be a subjective process. Since no two companies or transactions are identical, we must value a company relative to other transactions, taking into account differences in business, size, profitability, potential synergies, and growth prospects, as well as intangible differences, such as reputation and brand equity. Historical valuation relies on information that may not reflect undisclosed company-specific opportunities/capabilities. Since acquisition multiples are historical valuations, present circumstances should also be considered (e.g., a growing versus a mature industry, the interest rate environment, government regulations, etc.).

By covering critical topics such as valuation methods, due diligence, deal financing, and acquisition strategies, this course prepares students for key roles in investment banking, corporate finance, private equity, and strategic consulting. Graduates gain expertise in analyzing business opportunities, structuring transactions, and creating value for organizations through effective mergers and acquisitions. Professionals with M&A knowledge are in high demand across industries, particularly in financial services, technology, and consulting firms. Completing this course enhances career prospects for roles such as M&A Analyst, Investment Banking Associate, Corporate Development Manager, and Strategy Consultant. This skill set positions graduates to lead deal-making processes and drive organizational growth. One real-world example of a mergers and acquisitions project can be seen in the technology industry. A large software company sought to acquire a mid-sized cybersecurity firm to expand its service offerings and improve its competitive edge in data protection solutions. While the strategic rationale for the deal was sound, the company faced challenges during valuation and integration planning. The target company\u2019s financials included inconsistent revenue streams and complex contracts, which made determining an accurate valuation difficult. Additionally, the cultural and operational differences between the two firms posed risks to the post-acquisition integration process. To address these challenges, the acquiring company conducted thorough due diligence to analyze the target\u2019s contracts, intellectual property, and financial projections. A team of analysts applied Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and comparable transaction methodologies to derive a fair valuation for the target firm. Additionally, a cross-functional integration team was assembled to align operations, address cultural gaps, and ensure a seamless transition. This effort led to a successful acquisition that strengthened the acquirer\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities, drove revenue growth, and positioned the company as a market leader in data protection. This project highlights the importance of robust valuation techniques, diligent risk assessment, and careful integration planning in the success of M&A transactions. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 12: Hostile Takeovers Unlocking Your Potential Business Evaluation Precedent Transaction AnalysisHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticsuse the language and processes of M&A, including the basic knowledge about the language and roles, to describe the\u00a0 basic M&A process; identify critical issues, including the key elements and drivers of value in any M&A transaction; analyze the balance of key M&A elements (valuation, strategy, dilution, financing, and risk management) to determine how a particular transaction creates value for a buyer and a seller; develop a concept, design a deal, and present a proposal for an M&A transaction; a evaluate the most critical information relating to a prospective transaction and make an informed opinion about a proposed deal.Brunner, R.

The three basic determinants of interest rates are: The supply of funds, is determined primarily by the total households\u2019 savings. Demand for funds, comes from businesses who need funds to invest in plant, equipment, and inventories. The actions of the government and the Federal Reserve Bank also have an impact on interest rates. Although the vast majority of investors can be assumed to be risk-averse, it is possible for some investors to be\u00a0risk-neutral. Risk neutrality\u00a0implies that the investor does not take into account the level of risk. In other words, the coefficient of risk aversion, A, for a risk-neutral investor is\u00a0zero. Risk-neutral investors make decisions solely based on the expected return. There are also\u00a0risk-lovers\u00a0who derive more utility from taking additional risk. A risk lover adjusts the expected return upward when confronting more risk. In other words, these risk lovers enjoy taking risk. Not only do they not penalize the expected return for the risk they take, they even obtain satisfaction from more risk. For these risk lovers, the coefficient of risk aversion is\u00a0less than zero. Video: Trade-Off Between Risk and Return Before investing in mutual funds, investors should be aware of their management fees and other expenses. Operating expenses:\u00a0Operating expenses are incurred by the mutual fund through its normal operations and include administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the investment manager. Operating expenses are typically expressed as a percentage of total assets and may range from 0.2% to 2%. These expenses are deducted from the assets of the fund. Front-end load:\u00a0A front-end load is assessed when you purchase the shares, usually to pay the brokers who sell the funds. Loads reduce the money invested. For instance, when an investor invests $1,000 in a fund with a front-end load fee of 6%, $60 is taken out as the sales charge and only $940 is invested. Back-end load:\u00a0A back-end load is a redemption fee assessed when investors sell the shares. Usually, back-end loads start at 5%\u20136% and decline by 1% for each year the funds are left invested. These fees are also referred to as \u201ccontingent deferred sales charges.\u201d 12b-1 charges:\u00a0The 12b-1 charges cover the fund distribution costs such as advertising, promotional literature, including annual reports and prospectuses, and commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors. The 12b-1 fees are added to operating expenses to obtain the true annual expense ratio of the fund. The 12b-1 fees cannot be more than 1% of a fund\u2019s average net assets per year. The name \u201c12b-1\u201d is derived from the SEC rule that allows the fund to charge these fees. This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week. This lesson introduces the foundational concepts of risk and return, critical to effective portfolio design and investment analysis. By exploring how risk and return are measured, students will learn to evaluate potential investments and analyze historical data for informed decision-making. By completing this lesson, you will have a strong grasp of risk and return fundamentals, setting the stage for advanced portfolio management concepts in subsequent lessons. This lesson delves into the critical concepts of risk aversion, utility, and the allocation of assets across risky and risk-free investments. Students will learn to assess risk tolerance and make informed decisions about portfolio construction based on their unique risk preferences. By the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll have a firm grasp of how to assess risk tolerance and allocate assets effectively, laying the groundwork for advanced portfolio management strategies.

BADM 834: Portfolio Management provides students with a comprehensive understanding of investment strategies, asset allocation, and risk management techniques. This course is designed to prepare students for careers in investment management, financial analysis, and wealth advisory services. By mastering the principles of portfolio construction, optimization, and performance evaluation, graduates are equipped to design investment strategies that align with client goals, market conditions, and regulatory requirements. Professionals with expertise in portfolio management are in high demand across industries such as asset management, private banking, and financial consulting. BADM 834 serves as a foundation for roles such as Portfolio Manager, Investment Analyst, Financial Planner, and Risk Analyst. The hands-on experience gained through virtual portfolio projects and real-world case studies ensures students are prepared to excel in competitive and dynamic financial environments. A real-world example of portfolio management challenges can be seen in the financial advisory industry. A mid-sized investment firm was managing a high-net-worth client\u2019s portfolio with a goal of achieving steady growth while minimizing risk. However, the portfolio was poorly diversified, with an over-concentration in technology stocks that had performed well in recent years. When market conditions shifted, the portfolio experienced significant volatility, and the client\u2019s returns suffered during a tech sector downturn. To address this, a portfolio manager was brought in to reassess the investment strategy using principles learned in BADM 834. The manager conducted a thorough analysis of the portfolio\u2019s risk-return profile, rebalancing it to include a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative assets. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and other risk-adjusted measures, the manager identified assets with favorable risk-return characteristics. Additionally, they created a capital allocation line (CAL) to help the client visualize the impact of adding risk-free assets to the portfolio. The revised portfolio was better aligned with the client\u2019s risk tolerance and investment objectives, resulting in reduced volatility and improved long-term performance. This example highlights the critical role of portfolio management techniques, such as diversification, risk assessment, and optimization, in achieving sustainable investment success and client satisfaction. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Portfolio Performance Evaluation Unlocking Your Potential Costs of Investing in Mutual FundsHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticsanalyze the properties of, and issues behind, risk and \u201coptimal portfolios\u201d; understand the issues and use the tools underlying portfolio management; and evaluate the performance of a portfolio.Bodie, Z., Kane, A., & Marcus, A.

A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Dominare Fundamenta Incertitudinis Modulationis Unlocking Your Potential Course Requirements and GradingHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analyticsunderstand core concepts such as data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, classes, modules, and files; apply these programming concepts to create fully functional Python programs; gain a clear concept of the need for and use of abstraction in Computer Science; increased vocabulary of useful programming constructs; learn different tools used for writing and running Python code; allow a better choice of programming language constructs; and ability to learn a new language.following through the provided material(s); assessment of multiple choice and/or fill-in-the-blanks questions in tests after each lecture; and comprehensive labs and assignments that follow each lecture.ZyBooks: Data Structures Essentials: Pseudocode with Python Examples with ZyLabs (ISBN: 979-8-203-44388-5) ZyBooks: Programming in Python 3 with ZyLabs (ISBN: 979-8-203-44383-0)\n\nTo access zyBooks for this course, click on the zyBooks found in Module 1.\nLaunch the zyBooks platforms and subscribe.\nThe cost of a subscription is $99 for the year.

Additionally, having this expertise can open doors to senior roles like Business Analyst or Product Manager, leading to career growth and potentially higher compensation. One real-world example of a software requirements engineering problem can be seen in the healthcare industry. A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Dominare Fundamenta Incertitudinis Modulationis Unlocking Your Potential Required Textbook Explora Potentiam Probabilitatis et StatisticaeHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsLearn the significance of system architecture Learn fundamental concepts underlying a system architecture Learn models, methods, and tools for architecture development and analysis Demonstrate understanding of influences on system architecture decisions Explore architectural frameworks for documentation of system architectureSangwan, Raghvinder S.

Professionals have a specific role that determines their morality focus while practicing their profession. In reality, we portray many different roles in life where our focused obligation changes from role to role. Thus, role morality is the obligation associated with a specific role in life.\u00a0For example, a parent has an obligation not only to not harm a child but to care for that child and help them thrive.\u00a0Being professional is also an example of role morality. We know that morality is a little more complicated than just fulfilling the obligation of our profession.\u00a0It is broken down into three types of morality: (Click the tabs to learn more) Common morality: Set of moral ideals shared by most members of a culture or society.\u00a0Example: Do not steal. There are three characteristics of common morality: Personal morality: Examples: Stem cell research, abortion.\u00a0Set of one\u2019s own ethical commitments, usually learned at a young age at home or in religious training and may be modified by later reflection. Professional ethics: Standards adopted by professionals.\u00a0Example: specific professional code of ethics. The focus is on the issues that are important to that profession Often people do not think about the privacy and boundary crossing of technology.\u00a0Think about all of the databases that contain information about your income, purchasing habits, and political and religious affiliations.\u00a0More recently with the help of social networking sites information such as your exact GPS location is posted with a simple upload of your favorite photo from\u00a0your mobile phone. Are computers invading our privacy? Types of privacy: (Click the tabs to learn more) Physical privacy examples: Decisional privacy example: Freedom form anyone making decisions about your life such as your political/religious believes. One\u2019s beliefs can be easily exposed via technology. Proprietary privacy example: Controlling the use of one\u2019s name/likeness/identity. Technology can be used to assist in this violation by facilitating identity theft. The resources presented in this section can be thought of as a tool-kit to help solve boundary-crossing problems. The creative middle way attempts to honor the customs and/or competing moral demands of both the host and home country in some form (as long as they don\u2019t violate fundamental moral considerations). Basically, we are using the methods we know already to determine whether the creative middle way is ethically acceptable. We need to avoid two extremes: Moral Laxism and Moral Rigorism. Moral Laxism\u00a0is where moral principles cannot be strictly applied, we justify in applying them loosely in that moral constraints are almost completely abandoned.\u00a0A\u00a0laxist\u00a0allows solutions to moral problems that involve serious violations of moral standards. Moral Rigorism\u00a0is where moral principles must be strictly applied in every situation.\u00a0This extreme doesn\u2019t involve any violation of moral principles. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

A business wants to know the minimum amount they have to sell so that they will not lose money. To understand this, one needs to know the total revenue and the total costs. The volume at which the total costs equal the total revenue is the break-even point. Above that point, the company will make a profit and below that the company will lose money. The following variables need to be understood: In practice we often encounter situations where some of the variables have to be integers and others can be fractional; they are classified as mixed integer programming. The integer requirement is easily satisfied by constraining either all the variables or the required variables to be integer in the constraint window as shown below: A subset of integer programming problems is Binary Integer Programming (BIP). The decisions to be made are of the \u201cYes or No\u201d kind. By setting 1 for Yes and 0 for No, these problems are easily handled using Excel Solver. There are many applications of BIP, ranging from the choice to build a factory in Los Angeles or San Francisco, picking appropriate projects in capital budgeting, location of warehouses, assigning a crew to a particular flight and loading an item into a container or not. We now calculate the early start time and early finish time for each activity. The earliest start time of an activity is how soon an activity can be started. The earliest finish time is the early start time plus the duration of that activity. We can define the early start time of an activity as equal to the largest of the earliest finish times of its immediate predecessors. It took 8 weeks for the completion of the project. The early start and early finish times for the entire project are shown in the following figure. Now we need to calculate the latest start and latest finish time for all the activities. To do this we move from right to left instead of left to right, as we did in the calculation of early start and early finish calculations. This is known as a\u00a0backward sweep. Latest finish\u00a0is the time at which an activity has to finish. By subtracting the duration from the latest finish, we can get the latest start. Look at all the end activities \u2013 D, E, J and K. These activities are not in the predecessor list. As long as one completes these activities in 8 weeks there will be no penalty to the completion of the project. We calculate the Latest Start = Latest Finish \u2013 Duration. Activity D: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 2 Weeks; Latest Start = 6 Weeks:Activity E: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 3 Weeks; Latest Start = 5 Weeks:Activity J: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 3 Weeks; Latest Start = 5 Weeks:Activity K: Latest Finish = 8 Weeks; Duration = 4 Weeks; Latest Start = 4 Weeks: Now look at Activity I. Its duration is 1 week. This has to be completed before J starts. However, the latest start on J is 5 Weeks. That means activity J has to start at week 5. It follows then that the Latest Finish time on I is 5 weeks, and the latest start on activity I is 5 \u2013 1 or 4 weeks. Now look at Activity H.\u00a0Duration is 1 week. This has to be completed before activity I starts. But the latest start on I is 4 Weeks. That means activity J has to start at week 4. It follows then that the Latest Finish time on H is 4 weeks, and the latest start on activity H is 4 \u2013 1 or 3 weeks. Now look at activity G. This activity has to be completed before activity H begins. From above, we know activity H has to start on week 3. That means that G has to finish by week 3. The duration of activity G is 1 week and therefore the latest start on activity G is week 2. Now look at activity F. This activity has to be completed before activity K begins. From above, we know activity K has to start on week 4. That means that F has to finish by week 4. The duration of activity F is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity F is week 2. Now look at activity C. This activity has to be completed before activities E, H and K begin. From above, we know activity E has to start on week 5, activity H has to start on week 3, and activity K has to start on week 4. That means that C has to finish by week 3. The duration of activity C is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity C is week 1. The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors. Now look at activity B. This activity has to be completed before activities C and D begin. From above, we know activity C has to start on week 1, and activity D has to start on week 6. That means that B has to finish by week 1. The duration of activity B is 1 week and therefore the latest start on activity B is week 0.\u00a0 The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors. Now look at activity A. This activity has to be completed before activities D, E, F and G begin. From above, we know activity D has to start on week 6, activity E has to start on week 5, activity F has to start on week 2 and activity G has to start on week 2. That means that A has to finish by week 2. The duration of activity A is 2 weeks and therefore the latest start on activity A is week 0.\u00a0 The latest finish time of an activity is equal to the smallest of the latest start times of its immediate successors. The latest start and latest finish times, along with early times for the entire project, are shown in the following figure. The\u00a0slack for an activity\u00a0is the difference between its latest finish time and its earliest finish time.In symbols,Slack = LF \u2013 EF (Since LF \u2013 EF = LS \u2013 ES, either difference can actually be used to calculate slack.) Each activity with\u00a0zero slack\u00a0is on a\u00a0critical path\u00a0through the project network, to the extent that any delay along this path will delay project completion.\u00a0Critical path\u00a0is the sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to be able to meet the scheduled completion. Any delay in any of these activities will extend the project completion time. The figure below shows the activities having zero slack. This project has multiple critical paths. They are identified in the list of paths following the diagram.

Students will participate as an executive team in an interactive, multi\u00adplayer business game simulation to solve problems that were actually faced by global business executives in the\u00a0airline industry. They will interact as competing teams in four rounds of play to face four leadership challenges or crisis situations: a labor strike, a plane crash, a fuel crisis, and a hostile takeover. These challenges will assess students\u2019 use of different leadership styles based on the decisions they make. As in real life, students will experience some personal leadership challenges along the way, as work and life oftentimes intersect in this leadership and strategic thinking gamulation, and in life itself. A student tutorial video is available at\u00a0http://recurrenceinc.com/university/#tutorials\u00a0. Additional resources are provided below. Student teams will make two short (5-minute) video presentations on their progress on the game during Weeks 4 and 9 of the course, and a final presentation during Week 14 (10 minutes) on their overall team performance in the game and individual leadership styles demonstrated in the game based on a leadership style report provided by Recurrence Inc. During the\u00a0first presentation, teams will briefly report for 5 minutes on (1) how they arrived at their rationale for the decision they made on CRISIS #1: LABOR PERFECT STORM, (2) each team member\u2019s performance on the leadership challenges associated with the crisis, and (3) their team\u2019s current performance metrics of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and shareholder satisfaction.

Whether it was to create an entirely new market, leverage a market niche that hadn\u2019t been filled, or push innovation to its limits, Jobs, like most top executives, was driven by a specific purpose or strategy. Singh and Useem (2016, p. 41) define organizational strategy as \u201csetting the firm\u2019s general direction and identifying what creates sustainable value and advantage for the firm.\u201d While considering strategy, executive leaders, like Jobs, recognize that internal organizational changes must keep pace with what is happening in the external environment. As Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, once said \u201cWhen the rate of change outside exceeds the rate of change inside, the end is in sight.\u201d Leaders serve as the main role models for change and provide the motivation and communication to keep change efforts focused and moving forward, as Tim Cook, current CEO of Apple describes in the following video. In gathering information to feed into the strategic planning analyses shown in Step 4 of Figure 4.1, the task force performs an internal analysis. By studying the company\u2019s internal environment, the task force can determine what they do best. They focus on examining their unique resources and assets as well as the competencies their employees possess. The identification of such resources and assets allows them to determine their sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace (McGahan, 1999). The typical materials reviewed in this process are listed in the following video: Notice that the key steps in this process focus on identifying\u00a0strengths and weaknesses,\u00a0capabilities, and\u00a0competitive advantage\u00a0(i.e., condition or circumstance that puts a company in a favorable or superior business position). \u00a0Figure 4.3 shows the specific components of internal analysis used in the resource-based above-average return model. In early 2018, it was revealed that millions of Facebook users\u2019 personal information had been previously shared with\u00a0Cambridge Analytica\u00a0for the purported use of influencing the 2016 U. S. presidential election. When the word first hit Wall Street, Facebook\u2019s stock plummeted and it seemed that Facebook CEO\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0was nowhere to be found. The general public demanded accountability for such a violation of users\u2019 personal information security. At the same time, shareholders demanded answers as to how such a blunder could occur at one of the most popularly traded companies. In a tardy response to these calls for action, Zuckerberg relied on COO\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg\u00a0to lead a public relations initiative to provide explanations for what went wrong, and how Facebook would ensure that the data breach would never happen again (Aiello, 2018, April 5). Sandberg\u2019s response is shown in the following video: This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

Creating a stimulating and interactive online learning environment requires the active involvement of students through offline research, thoughtful analyses of topics, and active class participation. For most weeks of the course, a case for discussion will be posted by the instructor. These cases are evaluated in discussion forums and are related to the topics and/or assigned readings. The frequency of postings does not constitute quality (e.g., all talk does not constitute \u201cgood\u201d talk). Therefore, contributions to the discussions must present a clear understanding of the assigned material that is competently integrated into the discussion questions. In this course, the online learning environment simulates the classroom with regard to a community of learning. Interaction among students through discussion forums is an important component of creating positive, high-quality communal learning. Students are expected to complete all online exercises. Online input for weekly assignments closes at 11:59 PM Eastern on Sunday evenings. Students who participate in activities and discussion forums before each week\u2019s deadline receive credit toward that week\u2019s participation. Students who fail to meet this requirement do not receive credit for any activity that they do not complete by the due date. There are\u00a09 online participation activities\u00a0in LEAD 862. Thus, your final participation score is computed as the average score of the scores of each of the 9 activities.\u00a0This is a graduate-level course and high-quality participation/discussion is expected from graduate students. As part of a team project, students are expected to identify a senior-level or top executive who has strategic decision-making responsibilities at his or her organization, preferably a CEO, CFO, COO, CIO, or other C-level executives. The executive must be willing to be videotaped (or audio taped) during the interview so that a transcript can be created for drawing material from and providing evidence that the interview occurred. Students are expected to challenge each other\u2019s worldview of leadership and that of the instructor. In consultation with the instructor, students will implement a peer evaluation system. The dimensions to be used for evaluation and the method will be posted on the Peer Evaluation page. On the last day of class, each student is responsible for completing the Peer Evaluation, in which s/he evaluates the other team members on the evaluation dimensions.View\u00a0Recurrence Student Quick Start Guide View\u00a0Recurrence Game Mechanics GuideVarious elements of the strategic leadership system Organizational context/environment Leader\u2019s lifestream of biographic and demographic elements influencing leadership Perceptions of leadership behavior Top Management Teams (TMTs) Organizational Success Leadership GamulationOrganizational Strategy Internal Analysis for Strategy Strategic Leadership ModesStrategic Management and Leadership: Fundamentals of strategy formulation and the role of strategic leaders across different contexts.

The process of observation entitles to the systematic noting and recording of events, behaviors, and artifacts in the social setting chosen for study. The recordings of events are often referred to as\u00a0field notes. A qualitative researcher when performing an observation records frequently a detailed, nonjudgmental and concrete description of what was observed. The collection of data through observation can range from a highly structured, detailed notation of behavior structured by checklists to a more holistic description of the events and behavior. Generally a researcher enters the setting with broad areas of interest but without a predetermined categories or strict observational checklists. This way the researcher is able to make a note of all the recurring patterns of behavior and relationships. A complete analysis of the field notes is performed in order to identify and describe the patterns thus making the checklists more appropriate and context-sensitive. Performing classroom studies is a good example of observation in an educational setting. The figure 2.1 below shows a sample edited and cleaned-up field notes for a study of the Kindergarten teachers. The researcher has formatted the field note with descriptive notes in the column on the left while reserving the right side column for comments. Note that in the top the researcher has recorded the date and time of the observed event. In addition to that at times the researcher records the location of the observation. In this field note the researcher has recorded his observation about the room which is in the basement of the school. Pay a close attention to the details recorded in the field notes especially the number of people in the room, the age of the bricks that are part of the building, the dimension of the room, the location of the objects (furniture, racks books, toys etc.) in the room, pictures in the wall, the lighting conditions in the room etc. On the right hand side you can see the comments made by the researcher [1]. As indicated before, observation is a core part of the qualitative research studies. In every other qualitative study techniques observations play an important role. For example in in-depth interviews observations play a key role. When performing an in-depth interview the researcher makes a record of the participant\u2019s behavior, body language and other associated information in his field notes. In short, observation is an integral part of qualitative research study [1]. A type of observation developed primarily from cultural anthropology and qualitative sociology perspective is the method often referred to as participant observation. As the name suggest it requires the researcher to be an active participant and demands for the involvement of the researcher in the social setting. The immersion of researchers in the settings permits them to see, hear, and begin to experience reality as the participants do. This immersion offers the researcher the opportunity to learn directly from their own experience. Street ethnography is an example of participant observation where the researcher is immersed in a research setting that is usually associated with a dangerous environment. For example the researcher is working with the police, drug users, cults, and situations in which political or social tensions may erupt into violence [1]. Qualitative in-depth interviews (interviews) are typically conversations than formal events with predetermined response categories. It is often defined as a conversation with a purpose. Before researchers (interviewer) interviews the participants they explores few general topics to help uncover the participant\u2019s views but otherwise they respect participants frame and structure of responses. The objective of the researcher is to understand the participant\u2019s perspective on the phenomenon of interest which should unfold as the participant views it and not as the researcher views it. For a successful interview to be conducted, researcher should have some degree of systematization and structured questioning.\u00a0 Secondly, the researcher\u2019s attitude should be conveying the attitude that the participant\u2019s views are valuable and useful. Similar to observations even in interviews the researchers maintains a field note. The figure 2.2 below provides an elaborated sample field notes from an interview conducted for a study of students of color in a community college. The researcher objective was to understand how students identified and defined effective teachers. The field note records details about when and what time the interview was conducted and who was the participant, what role the participant plays (advisor with an academic department), interview location (setting), description of the participant and a detailed record of the conversation transcripts. The conversation transcripts, settings and description about the participants are recorded on the left hand column and the interviewer\u2019s notes are recorded in the right hand column. The researcher also makes sure that ethical issues have been taken in to consideration while questioning the participant. The strength of conducting interviews is that it can yield data in quantity quickly. However, it has several limitations. For a successful interview cooperation of the participant is essential. At times the participant will be unwilling, uncomfortable or may be unaware of the recurring patterns in their lives [1]. There are several more specialized forms of interviewing including ethnographic interviewing, phenomenological interviewing, elite interviewing, focus-group interviewing and interviewing children. The ethnographic questions are used by the researcher to gather cultural data of the participant. The value of the ethnographic interview lies in its focus on culture through the perspective of the participants. Using this approach a researcher can elicit from participants about the meaning for events and behaviors and for generating a typology of cultural classification schemes. Ethnographic interview generally focuses on eliciting knowledge about cultures from the perspective of the participants. The phenomenological interviews are specific type of interviews conducted to determine the meaning of a concept or a phenomenon that is shared by several individuals. An interview with an elite person is a specialized case of interviewing that focuses on a particular type of interviewee. They are generally considered to be the most influential person in the organization or community and are selected on the basis of their expertise in areas relevant to the research [1]. The method of interviewing participants in focus groups comes largely from marketing research widely adapted to social sciences and applied research. Small groups consisting of 4 to 12 participants who are unfamiliar with one another are selected to be interviewed because they all share certain characteristics relevant to the study\u2019s question. The focus group interviewing method assumes that an individual\u2019s attitude and beliefs do not form in a vacuum: people often listen to other\u2019s opinions and understandings to form their own. The questions framed by a researcher in a focus-group setting are deceptively simple so as to trick the participants in to expressing their views through the creation of a supportive environment. The advantage of focus group method is that it is socially oriented, studying participants in an atmosphere more natural than artificial experimental circumstances and more relaxed than a one-to-one interview. Disadvantages include issues related to power dynamics, researcher usually has less control over a group interview than on individuals, and there can be a considerable loss of time while dead-end or irrelevant issues are discussed. In some studies researchers consider interviewing children to learn more about the aspects of their world and how they perceive them. The major challenges for researchers in such interviewing process are selecting candidate based on age and role. Choosing between interviewing preschoolers and early adolescents can be quite challenging as preschoolers are active, and cannot be expected to sit still for long hours and can drive one to distraction with their incessant questions as they are in the verge of exploring their emerging language skills. On the other hand early adolescents can be taciturn and can fit well in to focus-group interviews with their peers or in to one-to-one type interviews. The researcher looks along two dimensions of roles when interviewing children namely the extent of positive contact between the adult and child and the extent to which the adult has direct authority over the child [1]. Survey is the most preferred way for the researchers to obtain a small amount of information from a large group of subjects (people).\u00a0 In survey based research questioners are generally used as tools or instruments. When researchers conduct a survey they generally administer questioners to a set of randomly chosen sample of participants to learn more about the distribution of characteristics, attitudes, or beliefs. The groups of people chosen by researcher are based on the assumption that a characteristic or belief of the group can be described or measured accurately through self-reporting. Researchers also rely on the fact that the participants address to the questioners accurately and honestly. A questioner typically entails several questions that have structured response categories and some open-ended questions. Questions in the questioner are examined (sometimes quite vigorously) for bias, sequence, clarity and face-validity. They are usually tested on a small group to determine their usefulness and, perhaps, reliability.\u00a0 Surveys are conducted in three ways: by email, telephone and personal interview. Surveys can be either conducted at any single point of time or taken at several different times. Once a survey is completed analysis of the survey data takes the form of descriptive or inferential statistics. Strength of surveys includes accuracy, generalizability, and convenience. Accuracy can however be enhanced by quantification, replicability and control over observer effects. Results of a survey can be generalized to a larger population within error bounds and they are amenable to rapid statistical analysis and are comparatively easy to administer and manage. However, surveys have several weaknesses. They do not accurately measure the complex social relationships or intricate patterns of interaction. Secondly, a survey cannot assure further evidence that the sample represents a broader universe\u00a0i.e.\u00a0results on a sample cannot be generalized over a population with 100% confidence [1]. Cyr and Bonanni in [2] have looked in to the difference in gender (male and female) perceptions in regard to their experience in online shopping.\u00a0 Their investigation was focused on examining how perceptions between the genders differ concerning transaction security, website design elements (InfoDesign- Information design, NavigDesign \u2013 Navigational design, VisDesign- Visual design), website trust, website satisfaction, and e-loyalty, when shopping online. In the Appendix survey of [2] they have provided a questioner that was used for this survey research. Their questioner included 23 questions classified under 7 different categories. For their questioner researchers used a 5-point Likert scale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) to capture the responses of the participants. The 5-point Likert scale allowed the participants to agree-disagree against each question with 1 representing \u201cdisagree\u201d and 5 representing \u201cagree\u201d. In another similar study, Srinivasan\u00a0et. al.\u00a0in [3] tried to determine if there was any significant difference among the factors namely the transactional security, information design, navigational design, visual design, web site trust, web site satisfaction, and e-loyalty over the sustainability of on-line banking for different banks in USA and in India. Their questioner (provided below in figure 2.3) also included 23 questions based on the 7 major categories. Here it is important to note that both the questioners are different (questions are different in both the questioner) even though they follow a similar pattern. The respondents were instructed to respond against each question in a 5-point Likert scale with 1 meaning \u201cless likely\u201d to 5 meaning \u201cmore likely\u201d. The questioner in figure 2.3 also includes several questions to collect the demographic information of the respondents. In order to design a questioner for your survey research there are several on-line tools namely Google spreadsheet surveys and survey monkey. These sites allow you to design and distribute electronic surveys to the respondents. A tutorial on how to design and distribute electronic surveys using Google spreadsheet surveys and survey monkey\u00a0is provided here.\u00a0This tutorial will help you to gain skills and experience with developing an on-line questioner for survey based research. In the process of performing a qualitative study, researchers come across scenarios where they have to retrieve background, geographical and historical data for a particular setting. Researchers generally supplement participant observation, interviewing, surveys with gathering and analyzing documents produced in the course of every-day events or constructed specifically for the research that they are currently working. Several documents including the Minutes of the meetings, logs, announcements, formal policy statements, letters etc. can be useful for the researchers in understanding the settings or group being studied. When the research subject is a society, community, or an organization then the archival data play a major role in supplementing other qualitative research methods. The specialized analytic approach of retrieving information from the documents is called content analysis. Content analysis has an advantage of being unobtrusive and nonreactive. Researchers first gather the data and then determine where the emphasis lies [1]. Raw data gathered through conducting interviews and observations (field note) now need to be converted to \u201cprocessed data\u201d through the process of transcription and translation. Transcription could be a complex process. For instance consider a scenario in which the researcher tape records an interview with a respondent and later transcribes the tape. In this process at critical junctions the researcher has to make a judgment involving placing something as simple as a period or a semicolon which otherwise has a potential to shape the meaning of the written word and, hence, of the interview itself. There are several other issues including judiciously drawing inferences and offering interpretations of linguistic patterns, transcribing sentences that were interrupted, topics left unfinished and in ascertaining the overall clarity of the discussions. Translation (from one language to another) on the other hand is more complex than transcribing because they involve more subtle issues related to connotation and meaning. There are several issues that the researcher has to address in the translation process including being a self-translator or involving a translator as part of the analysis, how to determine if a translation has been performed accurately and the subtle meanings of the original language has been captured, translating words and phrases with the same intensity from original language to the target language etc [1]. Finally, rich sources from which data can be collected include WWW (World Wide Web), databases, films, videos and photography. We will look in to WWW and databases in later lessons. In this section we will discuss about reviewing films, videos and photography.\u00a0 Anthropology related studies have a long history of retrieving data from films and photography. Films, videos and photography has the unique ability to capture visible phenomenon seemingly objectively-yet always from the perspective of the filmmaker. Films, video\u2019s and photography are especially valuable for discovery and validation. They document nonverbal behaviors and communication such as facial expressions, gestures, and emotions. Other advantages include capturing elements which human eyes fail to capture due to limitations, preservation and help in studying data from nonrecurring, disappearing, or rare events. Do these technologies have any weakness? Yes, there are several fundamental questions yet unanswered \u2013 What is the nature of the truth? Do these technologies manipulate reality? [1]. Obtaining data/information from literature, books, video (films) and photographs are beyond the scope of this course. In this course we will concentrate on obtaining information from on-line sources including Internet and on-line databases. In the next lesson we will shed some light on the technologies that can help us in collecting data automatically from the WWW or internet. Data analysis\u00a0is performed in order to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data source. This step includes both the manual inspection of the data samples as well as examining the metadata to gain an insight about the data properties and to detect any data quality issues. Transformation workflow and mapping rules\u00a0which is performed in order to account for the degree of heterogeneity in the number of different data sources and the dirtiness of the data. In this approach a large number of data transformation and cleaning steps are executed in order to map each source to a common data model for any given data warehouse. The schema-related transformations and cleaning are specified by a declarative query and mapping language as far as possible, to enable automatic generation of the transformation code. Verification\u00a0is performed (testing and evaluated) to ensure that the transformation workflow and the definitions are implemented correctly and in an effective manner on a sample or copy of the data source. This step also helps in improving the transformation definitions. Here one should be cautions to implement several iterations of the analysis, design and verification steps since some errors only become apparent after applying the transformations. Transformation\u00a0is performed by running the ETL workflow whenever there is a need for loading and refreshing the data warehouse or during answering queries from multiple sources. Backflow of cleaned data\u00a0is performed to keep the original sources in order after the errors and dirty data are removed and data is cleaned. This is done to keep the legacy applications improved and to avoid redoing the cleaning work for future data extractions.

Figure below shows the state of the data warehousing market as of February 2016. The quadrant on the top right shows the leaders in the market of enterprise data warehousing. The data warehouse solutions in the figure above provide complete software systems that support and manage data in one or many file management systems. These systems can perform relational processing and support access and data availability from independent analytical tools and interfaces. Oracle: Oracle focuses on cloud, real-time, and big data. It offers database solutions that run completely in-memory, which results in low-latency access for transactional and analytical applications. Oracle data warehouses can be hosted on either specialized appliances, cloud, or commodity machines. They take advantage of some key Oracle database features such as agile partitioning scheme, mature cost-based query optimizer, optimized indexing, security, and high-performance support for parallelism. Teradata: Teradata is the most comprehensive and scalable enterprise data warehousing platform. It offers advanced solutions for in-database analytics, distributed indexing, query optimization, self-service and automation, workload management, distributed query, and security. Querying systems from Teradata can work with a number of third party data management systems such as Hadoop or Oracle. IBM: IBM provides data warehousing appliances that rely on the in-house DB2 database and information management solutions. IBM\u2019s key differentiators lie in its advanced data compression, in-database analytics, real-time streaming, automated resource management, preconfigured vertical data models, virtualization, scalable appliances, and native integration with Hadoop platforms. SAP: SAP provides real-time data warehouse using a distributed, in-memory columnar parallel processing database engine. SAP solution is best suited for operational, analytical, and advanced analytical workloads and it is optimized for data streaming and query processing, advanced compression, cloud, and security. Microsoft: Microsoft has a significant presence in database management systems, online analytical processing, online transaction processing, business intelligence, and it is expanding its offering for cloud applications. Microsoft provides lower total cost of ownership, automation, skills availability, and support for hybrid platforms. The Azure SQL Data Warehouse works in the cloud and enables enterprises to scale data warehouses beyond tens of terabytes into petabyte-scale warehouses. Solutions from Microsoft provide sophisticated caching, compression, partitioning, indexing, cost-based query optimization, and workload management functionality. The Big Data model of computation was introduced by several large companies such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. These companies evolved into large consumers and creators of big data technologies when faced with large volumes of data for which legacy infrastructure was incapable of properly handle. Most of these technologies were custom built to fit the needs of the specific company that developed them. This trend followed with open source organizations embracing the trend and accelerating the new technologies by providing free of charge solutions. Most of the medium-size and small companies, which need knowledge in this data, cannot afford to build custom solutions is unfeasible. They started to use out-of-the-box big data systems for their needs. With continued influx of entrepreneurial money in the space, the number of companies that provide solutions in the area of big data increases continuously. Figure below shows the big data landscape as of 2016. Perhaps the most influential and established tool for analyzing unstructured data is Apache Hadoop. Apache Hadoop is a framework for storing and batch processing data in a large scale, and it is completely open source. Hadoop can run on commodity hardware, making it easy to use with an existing data center, or even to conduct analysis in the cloud. Hadoop is broken into four main parts: Hadoop Common\u00a0is a set of common libraries and utilities used by other Hadoop modules. Hadoop Distributed File System\u00a0(HDFS) is a distributed, scalable, and portable default storage layer for Hadoop. Data is broken down into smaller pieces and distributed throughout the cluster. In this way, the retrieval can be executed on smaller subsets of the data sets, and this provides the scalability that is needed for big data processing. MapReduce\u00a0was originally developed by Google and it was incorporated in Hadoop. It is the execution layer for a wide range of parallel analytic functions for analyzing datasets. The \u201cMap\u201d job distributes a query to different nodes, and the \u201cReduce\u201d gathers the results and resolves them into a single value. YARN\u00a0(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the cluster management layer of Hadoop. It decouples resource management and scheduling capabilities from the data processing component, enabling Hadoop to support more varied processing approaches and a broader array of applications. These four components form the basic Hadoop framework. However, the Apache big data solution includes a wide array of other components that aim to answer different information needs. Some the more well-known components include: Spark\u00a0is used on top of HDFS, and it is a fast, in-memory data processing engine that allow data processes to efficiently execute streaming, machine learning or SQL workloads that require fast iterative access to datasets. Spark is generally faster than MapReduce because of the way it processes data. While MapReduce operates in steps, Spark operates on the whole data set at once. Hive\u00a0was originally developed by Facebook and it is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. Hive provides a simple, a SQL-like language, whilst maintaining full support for MapReduce. This means SQL programmers with little former experience with Hadoop can use the system easier, and provides better integration with certain analytics packages like Tableau. Hive also provides indexes, making querying faster. HBase\u00a0is a NoSQL columnar database which is designed to run on top of HDFS. It is modelled after Google\u2019s BigTable and written in Java. It was designed to provide similar capabilities to BigTable in Hadoop, such as the columnar data storage model and storage for sparse data. Pig\u00a0is a high-level platform for creating programs that run on Apache Hadoop. It can perform all the data manipulation operations in Hadoop using a more abstract language called Pig Latin. All the Pig scripts are internally converted to Map and Reduce tasks which are ran against HDFS. This is an open source document store NoSQL database management system designed to make it easier for organizations to develop and run applications that address performance, availability and scalability, and support a variety of data types. Instead of storing data in tables as is done in a classical relational database, MongoDB stores structured data as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making integration with certain types of applications easier and faster. The document data model of MongoDB lets developers easily store and combine data of any structure, without sacrificing data access or indexing functionality. This enables database administrators to dynamically modify the schema with no downtime. This is a graph database that provides a scalable, open source database management system for graph data. It supports ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) properties and provides high-availability clustering for enterprise deployments. Graph databases focus on the connections among objects and provides efficient query and retrieval of these connection. They excel at managing highly connected data and complex queries and are suitable for social network analysis. The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process is one of the most important steps the analytical process on data warehouses. It is very time-consuming, and it is typically the most underestimated task in building a data warehouse. The ETL process addresses and resolves the challenges of extracting data from disparate sources, profiling data for errors, cleaning and transforming the data, and loading it into the target data warehouse. Source systems can be varied such as mainframe, relational databases, real-time systems, web pages, and/or desktop systems.

Two common choices are the pie chart and the bar chart. each sector of the circle represents the percentage of that category The height of the bar for each category is equal to the frequency (number of observations) in the category. Leave space in between the bars to emphasize that there is no ordering in the classes. An estimate for a parameter that is one numerical value. An example of a point estimate is the sample mean or the sample proportion. Interval estimates give an interval as the estimate for a parameter. This is a new concept which is the focus of this lesson. Such intervals are built around point estimates which is why understanding point estimates is important to understanding interval estimates. An interval of values computed from sample data that is likely to cover the true parameter of interest. There are many estimators for population parameters. For example, if we want to know the \u201ccenter\u201d of a distribution, why use the mean? Could we use the median? How about using the middle value, i.e. (max+min)/2? We choose particular estimators for various reasons with information based on their sampling distributions. Here are some properties of \u201cgood\u201d estimators. The primary method for displaying the summarization of categorical variables is called a\u00a0contingency table.\u00a0When we have two measurements on our subjects that are both categorical, the contingency table is sometimes referred to as a\u00a0two-way table. This terminology is derived because the summarized table consists of rows and columns (i.e., the data display goes two ways). The size of a contingency table is defined by the number of rows times the number of columns associated with the levels of the two categorical variables. The size is notated\u00a0r\u00d7c, where\u00a0r\u00a0is the number of rows of the table and\u00a0c\u00a0is the number of columns. A\u00a0cell\u00a0displays the count for the intersection of a row and column. Thus the size of a contingency table also gives the number of cells for that table. For example, if we have a\u00a02\u00d72\u00a0table, then we have\u00a02(2)=4\u00a0cells. As we will see, these contingency tables usually include a \u2018total\u2019 row and a \u2018total\u2019 column which represent the marginal totals, i.e., the total count in each row and the total count in each column. This total row and total column are NOT included in the size of the table. The size refers to the number of levels to the actual categorical variables in the study. Upon the successful completion of this course, students should be able to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

A traditional data mining architecture provides a framework for several methods of data exploration and preprocessing. Among the tasks used in data exploration we enumerate: The model building phase involves the development of a predictive and or descriptive model based on the application of machine learning algorithms. These models are constructed to identify generalized patterns from the intrinsic patterns stored in the data. The deployment phase involves the application of the model generated to perform decision making. This is an important phase where profiling and user modeling are then applied to life situations. Simplistic applications of data mining tend to merely employ the model to predict the likelihood of events, occurrences, based largely on past patterns. Amazon, for example, can recommend books according to a user\u2019s profile. Similarly, network operators are able to track fraudulent activities in the usage of phone lines, by tracking deviation patterns as compared to standard usage characterization. To mine association rules in Knime, one needs to install the \u201cKnime Itemset Mining\u201d Extension. To do this, click\u00a0Help -> Install new software, and then search \u201cKnime Itemset Mining\u201d. The workflow for association rule mining is shown below: To mine association rules in Knime, we need to have the data in a table with the following format. {Transaction, Item} An example of input data is shown below. To make data appropriate for rule mining, we need to convert it to a collection type data. We can do this using a \u201cGroupBy\u201d node with the following setting: The result of this node will be a dataset with the following structure: With this data format, we can generate frequent itemsets. The setting of the node is as shown below. The resulting itemsets are as shown below: Further, association rules can be generated with the \u201cAssociation rule learner\u201d. The resulting rules have the following form: Distributed/Collective Data Mining One area of data mining that is attracting a good amount of attention is that of distributed and collective data mining. Much of the data mining which is being done currently focuses on a single database, data warehouse, or storage cluster that is managed by a unique entity. However, the situation arises where information may be located in different places and be owned by multiple agents. This is known generally as distributed data mining. Therefore, the goal is to effectively mine distributed data which is located in heterogeneous sites. Examples of this include biological information, data which comes from the databases of two different companies from the related area of business, or analysis of data from different branches of a corporation. For all these examples combining data is considered an expensive and time-consuming process. Distributed data mining is used to offer a different approach to traditional approaches analysis, by using a combination of localized data analysis tools, together with a global data model and aggregator of local results. In more specific terms, this is specified as performing local data analysis for generating partial data models, and-combining the local data models from different data sites to develop the global model. This global model combines the results of the separate analyses. Often the global model produced, especially if the data in different locations have different features or characteristics, may become incorrect or ambiguous. This problem is especially critical when the data in distributed sites are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous. Ubiquitous Data Mining The increased usage of laptops, tablets, cell phones, and wearable computers is making ubiquitous access to a large quantity of data possible. Advanced analysis for extracting useful knowledge from data on such devices is an obvious step in the world of ubiquitous computing. Accessing and analyzing data from a ubiquitous computing device offer many challenges. For example, ubiquitous data mining introduces additional costs due to communication, computation, security, and other factors. So one of its objectives is to mine data while minimizing the cost of ubiquitous presence. Human-computer interaction is another challenging aspect of ubiquitous data mining. Visualizing patterns like classifiers, clusters, associations, and others, in portable devices are usually difficult. The small display areas offer serious challenges to interactive data mining environments. Data management in a mobile environment is also a challenging issue. Moreover, the sociological and psychological aspects of the integration between data mining technology and our lifestyle are yet to be explored. The key issues to consider when addressing ubiquitous data mining in into the area of algorithms customization for mobile and distributed applications, data management issues, mark-up languages and other data representation techniques, development of database applications for mobile environments, solving architectural issues, location management issues and advances in web-based applications. Hypertext and Hypermedia Data Mining Hypertext and hypermedia data mining include mining of text, hyperlinks, mark-ups, and various other forms of hypermedia information. It is closely related to both web mining, and multimedia mining. While the World Wide Web is substantially composed of hypertext and hypermedia elements, there are other kinds of hypertext/hypermedia data sources which are not found on the web. Examples of these include the information found in online catalogs, digital libraries, online information databases, etc. Some of the important data mining techniques used for hypertext and hypermedia data mining include classification, clustering, semi-structured learning, and social network analysis. One application of classification is in the area of web topic directories, which can group similar sounding or spelled terms into appropriate categories so that searches will not bring up inappropriate sites and pages. The use of classification can also result in searches which are not only based on keywords, but also on category and classification attributes. Unsupervised learning could help group documents by their content which would result in more similar documents being placed closer when displayed to the end user. Semi-supervised learning and social network analysis are other methods which are important to hypermedia based data mining. Semi-supervised learning is the case where there are both labeled and unlabeled documents, and there is a need to learn from both types of documents. Social network analysis is also applicable because the web is considered a social network, which examines networks formed through collaborative association, whether it be between friends, academics doing research or service on committees, and between papers through references and citations. Multimedia Data Mining Multimedia Data Mining is the mining and analysis of various types of multimedia data, including images, video, audio, and animation. Multimedia data mining incorporates areas of text mining, as well as hypertext/hypermedia mining as these fields, are closely related. Multimedia information, because of its nature as a large collection of multimedia objects, must be represented differently from conventional forms of data. One approach is to create a multimedia data cube which can be used to convert multimedia-type data into a form which is suited to analysis using one of the main data mining techniques but taking into account the unique characteristics of the data. This may include the use of measures and dimensions for texture, shape, color, and related attributes. In essence, it is possible to create a multidimensional spatial database. Another developing area in multimedia data mining is that of audio data mining. The idea is basically to use audio signals to indicate the patterns of data or to represent the features of data mining results. The basic advantage of audio data mining is that while using a technique such as visual data mining may disclose interesting patterns from observing graphical displays, it does require users to concentrate on watching patterns, which can become monotonous. Spatial and Geographic Data Mining Spatial data mining has a unique characteristic of including extra information which is of an entirely different kind: objects are related by their spatial and geographic location. Much of this data is image-oriented and can represent a great deal of information if properly analyzed and mined. Spatial data mining involves the extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relationships, or other patterns not explicitly stored in spatial databases. Some of the components of spatial data which differentiate it from other kinds include distance and topological information, which can be indexed using multidimensional structures, and which requires special spatial data access methods, together with spatial knowledge representation. Analyzing spatial and geographic data include tasks such as understanding and browsing spatial data, uncovering relationships between spatial data items, or analysis on spatial databases and spatial knowledge bases. The applications of these would be useful in such fields as remote sensing, medical imaging, navigation, and related uses. Some of the challenges in constructing a spatial data warehouse include the difficulties of integration of data from heterogeneous sources, and also the usage of on-line analytical processing which is not only relatively fast, but also offers some forms of flexibility. Time Series/Sequence Data Mining Another important area in data mining centers on the mining of time series and sequence-based data. This involves the mining of a sequence of data, which can either be referenced by time or by other means. In general, one aspect of mining time series data focuses on the goal of identifying trends or components which exist within the data. These can include long-term trend movements, seasonal variations, cyclical variations, and random variations. Another task I time series is a similarity search and tries to identify a pattern sequence that is identical or similar to a given pattern. Constraint-Based Data Mining Many of the current data mining techniques lack the benefit of any guidance or user control. One method of implementing some form of human interaction into data mining is in the form of constraint-based data mining. This form of data mining incorporates the use of constraints that guide the process. There are several categories of constraints that can be used, each of which has its own characteristics and purpose, such as: Subject-Based Data Mining Subject-based data mining is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. It is very useful in the context of combating terrorism. Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other data that is considered to be of high interest, based on some predefined information. It has the goal to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements are related to that initiating datum.

Data transformation is the process of consolidating data to be suitable for visualization and model generation. Examples of data mining tasks are data reduction, aggregation, and projection. Data cleaning is the part of the data exploration stage that addresses the handling of noisy data, missing values, or irrelevant attributes. Data selection is the task of selecting the relevant data that is suitable for building a data mining model.Note that Apriori and FP-growth are options for generating the itemsets. Maximal or closed frequent itemsets can be generated by choice. Also, a minimum threshold on the support can be set in either relative or absolute fashion.Knowledge-type constraints specify the type of knowledge to be mined and is typically specified at the beginning of any data mining query. Data constraints identify the data which is to be used in the specific data mining query. Dimension/level constraints specify constraints related to the levels or dimensions of data to be included in the data mining task. Interestingness constraints specify ranges of a particular variable or measures that are considered to be particularly interesting and should be included in the data mining task.

This model may be familiar to you already, with its four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. There are many engineering design methodologies taught and used in academia and industry. Each one is a process aimed at solving problems of design and invention.  Let\u2019s look at the example shown below and begin an analysis. The design methodology shown here was originally developed for hardware design, but the general template can be adapted for any engineered system. Note, too (as mentioned in the excerpt below the figure), that even this fairly detailed diagram (like all processes) is an idealization; in actual implementation, engineers using this design methodology may skip stages or operate using a less formal structure, particularly in small companies. In the first case (recognition of need), we can expect a person\u2019s level (knowledge, experience, etc.) to have a direct effect on the opportunities (needs) that person perceives to be important \u2013 so, for example, an expert may focus on more complex or advanced gaps in technology than a novice in the field. Likewise, in terms of style, we might expect a more innovative engineer to find opportunities that span several technical domains to be of greater interest, while a more adaptive colleague prefers to focus on critical gaps within a single domain. And so on. In the case of proposal evaluation, one\u2019s level will impact how deeply and accurately one can evaluate another person\u2019s work, and one\u2019s style is bound to impact one\u2019s judgment of the proposed solution. So, for example, a more adaptive evaluator may find a particular proposal to be lacking in detail, while a more innovative reviewer finds the detail provided in the same proposal stifling! Once again, these variations represent only a small sampling of the cognitive diversity we can expect to see, but they should be enough to get you started on a deeper investigation. In this lesson we explore problem-solving leadership, and here, all the concepts and issues that underlie our understanding of the individual problem solver and problem solving teams must be revisited, but from a new perspective: the problem solving leader. The focus is the leadership of all, one\u2019s social role within the team (\u201cme, facilitating others\u201d), and the responsibilities inherent in managing oneself and others (obligation vs. reward \u2013 or \u201cright to be in the team\u201d). In dealing with problem solving leadership, we must move beyond an understanding of the management of change to a teaching program for how to do it. When leadership is the focus, our fundamental aim is mutual effective achievement. Our main element of theory here is the management of diversity as the foundation for the management of change, as well as the dangers of success (an outcome of the catalytic nature of change and our escalating expectations and demands for success). Finally, our practical entry points are the Pendulum of Change and (in contrast to) the Spiral of Change, two particular patterns for the progression of change.

These activities jointly realize a business goal.\u00a0A simple\u00a0example of a business process\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0ordering process\u00a0of the reseller. This business process consists of 5 activities:\u00a0\u202fReceive\u00a0Order,\u202f\u202fSend\u00a0Invoice,\u202fReceive Payment,\u202fShip Products, and\u202fArchive Order. All these activities can be executed in a\u00a0sequence,\u00a0one after another, or\u00a0one or\u00a0more\u00a0activities\u00a0can be executed\u00a0in\u00a0parallel\u00a0[1]. The\u00a0Enterprise\u00a0Application Integration\u00a0or EAI is\u00a0the task of uniting the databases and workflows associated with business applications to ensure that the business uses the information consistently and that changes to core business data made by one application are correctly reflected in others.\u00a0Round the world, EAI\u00a0face\u00a0challenges in integrating\u00a0the\u00a0complex\u00a0enterprise applications in a\u00a0heterogenous\u00a0information technology landscape. These enterprise applications\u00a0are often\u00a0developed independently of\u00a0each other,\u00a0and\u00a0they\u00a0store\u202fdata locally.\u00a0As such they are\u00a0siloed applications. For example,\u00a0in an organization,\u00a0siloed enterprise applications such as the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM) and\u00a0the\u00a0Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems all\u00a0exhibit\u202fdata heterogeneity. However, these applications\u00a0need to share data among themselves to successfully\u00a0enact a business process.\u00a0Therefore, it becomes necessary to integrate\u00a0all these\u00a0enterprise applications.\u00a0To remedy the data heterogeneity\u00a0issue\u00a0and to ensure that\u00a0all\u00a0the enterprise applications can be integrated\u00a0properly it is\u00a0required\u00a0to\u00a0identify\u00a0a suitable\u00a0middleware solution.\u00a0There are several middleware solutions including\u00a0the\u00a0point-to-point integration,\u00a0the\u00a0message-oriented middleware,\u00a0the\u00a0Hub-and-Spoke middleware\u00a0using\u00a0message brokers,\u00a0the\u00a0workflow management systems,\u00a0and\u00a0the Service-oriented architecture (SOA) using the ESB [1]. The process landscape diagram is shown in figure\u00a02. This diagram\u00a0represents\u00a0the supplier-customer relationships between the different business functions\u00a0of an organization.\u00a0Let\u2019s\u00a0take a simple example to illustrate the information conveyed through the process landscape diagram. Consider the business function\u00a0innovation process. The supplier to the\u00a0innovation process\u00a0business function are the\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0who supply the business function with the\u00a0market challenges. The\u00a0innovation process\u00a0business function now serves as a supplier for the two other business functions namely the\u00a0product planning process\u00a0and the\u00a0product development process\u00a0by supplying the product innovation and\u00a0prototype\u00a0respectively. In other words, the\u00a0product planning process\u00a0and the\u00a0product development process\u00a0are the customers of the\u00a0innovation process. The\u00a0product planning process\u00a0supplies\u00a0the product specification to the\u00a0product development process\u00a0which in turn supplies the innovative products to the\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0(see figure\u00a02).\u00a0It should be noted\u00a0here\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0product planning process\u00a0and the\u00a0marketing process\u00a0are both\u00a0the\u00a0suppliers and\u00a0the\u00a0customers of each other\u00a0suppling\u00a0the product innovation\u00a0[1].

Therefore, to determine the price of any financial instrument, it is required to have an estimate of (i) the expected cash flows, and (ii) the appropriate required yield to be used to calculate present values of the expected cash flows. We will discuss how to measure the appropriate required yield in Chapter 3. Here we will first focus on the expected cash flows. The expected cash flows for a coupon bond that the issuer cannot retire prior to its stated maturity date consist of: In general, the current or market price of a bond can be calculated by using the formula in equation 5: Let\u2019s say you plan to buy a bond which pays coupons twice a year, which is a semi-annual coupon bond. What should be the price of this semi-annual coupon bond?

Characteristics of interest rate caps include: Alpha manufacturing (Alpha) plans to borrow $20 million for 10 years from Beta\u00a0Commercial\u00a0Bank (BCB) at an interest rate of 2% over 3-month LIBOR\u00a0as shown in Figure 7.1.

BUSAD 827 equips students with advanced knowledge and practical skills in fixed-income securities, derivatives, and portfolio management. This course is designed to prepare individuals for high-impact roles in investment management, risk analysis, and financial consulting by teaching techniques for evaluating and pricing complex financial instruments such as bonds, swaps, and interest-rate derivatives. Graduates of this course gain a competitive edge in the financial sector, as they are equipped to assess risk, develop effective investment strategies, and manage portfolios with precision. Professionals who complete BADM 827 are well-positioned for roles such as Fixed-Income Analyst, Portfolio Manager, Financial Risk Manager, or Derivatives Trader. This expertise is highly sought after by employers in investment banks, asset management firms, and financial consulting organizations. Mastery of the concepts taught in this course can significantly enhance career prospects in the competitive financial services industry. One real-world example related to the concepts taught in BADM 827: Advanced Fixed-Income Securities Analysis can be found in the 2008 financial crisis. During this period, many institutional investors and banks held complex financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in their portfolios. These instruments were structured with embedded options and other features that made their valuation challenging. Many institutions relied on traditional yield spread measures without fully understanding the risks or applying more sophisticated tools, such as option-adjusted spreads (OAS) or static spreads, to assess their true value and risk exposure. As the housing market collapsed and interest rates fluctuated, the lack of accurate pricing and risk management techniques led to significant losses. For example, large financial institutions faced liquidity issues because they underestimated the sensitivity of these securities to market changes. To address this, some firms turned to advanced valuation techniques, including the use of binomial interest-rate trees and OAS, to reassess their portfolios and make more informed decisions about restructuring their holdings. This situation highlights the importance of mastering fixed-income valuation and risk management techniques, such as those taught in BADM 827. By using these advanced methodologies, financial professionals can better evaluate complex instruments, anticipate market risks, and develop strategies to protect institutional portfolios. These skills not only prevent financial losses but also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and foster long-term stability in the financial markets. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Interest-Rate Swaps Unlocking Your Potential Basic Structure of Plain Vanilla Interest Rate SwapHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsExplain the various features of fixed income securities and how those features affect the risks associated with investing in these securities.

We will briefly examine each of these markets, key statistics, and how we will examine them throughout this course. (SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE) First, we will look at Debt Markets & Interest Rates. Debt markets allow governments, corporations, and individuals to borrow.\u202fThe borrowers will issue a security, called a bond, offering interest and principal over time.\u202fThe interest rate is the cost of borrowing. Moreover, many types of market interest rates co-exist such as mortgage rates, car loan rates, credit card rates, etc. The levels of these rates are important. For example,\u202fmortgage rates in the early part of\u202f1983\u202fexceeded\u202f13%.\u202fLastly, understanding the history of interest rates is beneficial\u202fas it lets you see the\u202ffluctuation\u202fof these rates over time. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\u00a0FRED database In Lesson 2 (chapters 3 through 4), we will examine the characteristics of interest rates before examining its roles in\u00a0various debt markets in the economy in Lesson 3 (chapters 5, 11 and 12). The stock market is the market where common stock (or just stock) are traded.\u202fCompanies initially sell stock (in the primary market) to raise money. After that, the stock is traded\u202fin the secondary market\u202famong investors.\u202fThe stock market receives the most attention from the media.\u202fAs suggested by Figure 1.2, stock prices are extremely volatile. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\u00a0FRED database Companies, not just individuals, also watch the market\u202foften to\u202fseek additional funding\u202fvia seasoned equity offerings (SEOs).\u202fThe success of SEOs is dependent on the company\u2019s stock\u202fperformance. We will examine the role of the stock market in the financial system\u202fwhile we\u202fwill further look at how stock prices behave to information in the marketplace\u202fin Lesson 4 (chapters 6 and 13). The foreign exchange market is where international currencies trade and exchange rates are set.\u202fAlthough most people know little about this market,\u202fas you can see in Figure 1.3,\u202fit has a\u202fdaily\u202fvolume around $5 trillion! Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\u00a0FRED database These fluctuations matter\u202fnot only to corporation, but also consumers!\u202fIn recent years, consumers have found that vacationing in Europe is expensive, due to a weakening dollar relative to the Euro.\u202fWhen the dollar strengthens, foreign purchase of domestic goods falls. In\u202fLesson 5 (chapter 15\u202fand its Appendix), we will examine how exchange rates are determined in both the short- and long-run. In the past years, the economic environment has become more volatile than ever before and an increasingly risky place. For example, interest rates unpredictably fluctuated, stock market experienced crash and bubbles one after another in US and abroad. Foreign exchange market has not been an exception to the speculative crises. Amid financial turmoil, failure of financial institutions is not uncommon, reaching unprecedented level since the Great Depression. To avoid wild swings in profitability (and even possibly failure) resulting from this environment, financial institutions must find ways to cope with increased risks in various financial markets. Before we look at techniques that these financial institutions use to manage unnecessary risks in Lesson 7 (Chapter 23), we will look at how these financial institutions make use of new financial derivatives, such as financial futures, options and swaps to engage in risk management in Lesson 6 (Chapter 24). We will look at the basic reasoning behind the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). We also examine empirical evidence examining this idea.\u00a0Lastly, we will look at what the EMH implies for investors. (SELECT TITLES TO LEARN MORE) Theoretically, the EMH tells us that current prices in a financial market will be set so that the optimal forecast of a security\u2019s return using all available information equals the security\u2019s equilibrium return.\u00a0To put it differently, financial economists state it more simply: A security\u2019s price fully reflects all available information in an efficient market.\u00a0How could it be possible? To fully understand why the EMH makes sense, we need to understand how arbitragers can engage in an unexploited profit opportunity where they can earn arbitrage profits. We will discuss how arbitrage profits can be earned in detail later in lesson 5, but for now, let\u2019s define the unexploited profit opportunity. When an\u00a0unexploited profit opportunity\u00a0arises on a security (so-calledbecause, on average, people would be earning more than they should, given the characteristics of that security), investors will rush to buy until the price rises to the point that the returns are normal again. If financial markets are\u00a0efficient,\u00a0then\u00a0all unexploited profit opportunities will be eliminated\u00a0instantaneously\u00a0so that not every investor need be aware of every security and situation\u00a0to identify whether the current price is in its equilibrium. If a few\u00a0(namely arbitragers)\u00a0keep their eyes open for unexploited profit opportunities, they will eliminate the profit opportunities that appear because in so doing, they make a profit. Let\u2019s first look at empirical evidence\u00a0supporting\u00a0the market efficiency. (SELECT EACH TAB BELOW) Theoretically, the weak-form EMH suggests that technical analysis (which focuses on past stock price data, searching for patterns such as trends and regular cycles, suggesting rules for when to buy and sell stocks) is a waste of time because all information on past stock price data is already reflected into the current stock price. The simplest way to understand why is to use the random-walk result that holds that past stock price data cannot help predicting changes. Therefore, technical analysis, which relies on such data to produce its forecasts, cannot successfully predict changes in stock prices because the weak-form EMH assumes that stock price will move randomly in the future. Foreign exchange (FX) rates are a good example supporting the weak form EMH. Oddly enough, empirical tests show that FX rates exhibit random walk behavior like stocks so that they are not very predictable based on past trends. Theoretically, the semi-strong form of EMH suggests that not only past stock price data, but also all publicly available information are already reflected into the current stock price so that a positive (negative) announcement about a company will not, on average, raise (lower) the price of its stock because this information is already reflected in the stock price. Early empirical evidence confirms: any expected favorable earnings announcements or announcements of stock splits (a division of a share of stock into multiple shares, which is usually followed by higher earnings) do not, on average, cause stock prices to rise. Therefore, investment strategies using inside information is the only \u201cproven method\u201d to beat the market under the semi-strong EMH. In the U.S., it is illegal to trade on such information, but that is not true in all countries. The strong form EMH argues that not only past stock price data and public information, but also inside information are already reflected into the current stock price so that stock price movement cannot be predicted and follows random walk behavior. Empirical evidence supporting the strong-form EMH includes: The \u201cInvestment Dartboard\u201d often beats investment managers; Mutual funds not only do not outperform the market on average, but when they are separated into groups according to whether they had the highest or lowest profits in a chosen period, the mutual funds that did well in the first period do not beat the market in the second period. We will now examine some of the more recent evidence that casts some doubt on Market Efficiency. Early empirical studies are generally supporting the efficient market hypothesis, but recent studies have begun to show market anomalies which indicate the efficient market hypothesis may not always be generally applicable. Market anomalies are great challenges to the theory of efficient markets so that investors might be able to earn abnormal returns by exploiting market anomalies listed below. Now let\u2019s look at what implications the EMH provides to investors by considering the following questions. (Scroll through each slide to learn more) According to the\u00a0semi-strong EMH, information in the published reports by sell-side analysts is readily available to many market players and is already reflected in the market price. Therefore, acting on this information will not allow investors to earn abnormal returns. One question arises from this argument. If this is true, then we should not observe sell-side analysts to issue their research reports any longer. But, we have more than 3,000 sell-side analysts working in the US stock markets. A large literature in finance and accounting documents that sell-side analysts provide value to investors through their research reports. Specifically, analyst upgrades (to earnings, price targets, recommendations) result in positive abnormal returns while downgrades result in negative abnormal returns. The literature identifies two main ways in which analysts provide value. First, analysts engage in\u00a0information discovery, where they generate new signals regarding firm fundamentals by talking to the management of the firm, its competitors, suppliers etc. Second, analysts engage in\u00a0information interpretation, where they quantify the value implication of information events that affect the firm, such as earnings releases or other industry or macro news. In information discovery, the analyst generates private or proprietary information, while in information interpretation, the analyst reacts to public information. (please see\u00a0Daniel, Lee, and Naveen, 2019\u00a0for more information on the role of sell-side analysts) YES. The EMH indicates that you should be skeptical of hot tips since, if the stock market is efficient, it has already priced the hot tip stock so that its expected return will equal the equilibrium return. Thus, the hot tip is not particularly valuable and will not enable you to earn an abnormally high return. As soon as the information hits the street, the unexploited profit opportunity it creates will be quickly eliminated. The stock\u2019s price will already reflect the information, and you should expect to realize only the equilibrium return. NO. In an efficient market, stock prices will respond to announcements only when the information being announced is new and unexpected. So, if good news was expected (or as good as expected), there will be no stock price response. And, if good news was unexpected (or not as good as expected), there will be a stock price response. Investors should not try to outguess the market by constantly buying and selling securities. This process does nothing but incur commissions costs on each trade. Instead, the investor should pursue a \u201cbuy and hold\u201d strategy\u2014purchase stocks and hold them for long periods of time. This will lead to the same returns, on average, but the investor\u2019s net profits will be higher because fewer brokerage commissions will have to be paid. It is frequently a sensible strategy for a small investor, whose costs of managing a portfolio may be high relative to its size, to buy into a mutual fund rather than individual stocks. Because the EMH indicates that no mutual fund can consistently outperform the market, an investor should not buy into one that has high management fees or that pays sales commissions to brokers but rather should purchase a no-load (commission-free) mutual fund that has low management fees. As we practiced, the change in interest rate will affect both NIM and Net worth of the First National Bank as summarized below. What can the bank manager do to manage interest-rate risk once the manager has done the income gap analysis and duration gap analysis? Deciding which strategy to choose to manage interest rate risk will depend on the manager\u2019s expectation/belief about how interest rate will move in the future. The manager may have two strategies available to choose from to hedge against possible interest rate hike in the future depending on which gap analysis the manager prefers to use. One problem with eliminating the interest rate risk for the bank by altering the balance sheet (i.e, selling long-term assets to buy short-term assets to decrease DURASSETS) is that doing so might be very costly in the short run because the bank may be locked into assets and liabilities of particular durations because of its field of expertise. Fortunately, recently developed financial derivatives, such as interest-rate futures/forward and interest-rate options can help the manager mitigate potential interest rate risk without rearranging its balance sheets. Next, we will discuss how an interest-rate swap can help the manager manage the interest rate risk. Let\u2019s first understand key attributes of a typical plain vanilla\u00a0[6]\u00a0interest rate swap before discussing how to use it for hedging purpose. Suppose there are two financial institutions: Midwest Savings Bank (MSB) and Friendly Finance Company (FFC). Midwest Savings Bank (MSB)\u00a0which borrows short-term mostly from depositors in a form of deposits and lends long-term in the mortgage market has $1 million less of rate-sensitive assets (RSAs) than it has of rate-sensitive liabilities (RSLs). As we discussed, MSB currently has negative income gap (RSAs<RSLs) by $1 million. The negative income gap suggests that if interest rate rise in the future, the rise in the cost of funds (liabilities) is greater than the rise in interest incomes it can earn on assets, more of which are fixed-rate mortgage, leading to a shrinking of MSB\u2019s NIM (net interest margin) and a decline in its profitability. In the meanwhile, the manager of the\u00a0Friendly Finance Company (FFC)\u00a0which issues long-term bonds to raise funds and uses them to make short-term loan finds that FFC is in exactly the opposite position to MSB: FFC has $1 million more of RSAs than of RSLs so that FFC has positive income gap (RSAs>RSLs) by $1 million. The positive income gap suggests that if interest rate falls in the future, the decline in interest incomes it can earn on assets is greater than the decrease in the cost of funds (liabilities), leading to a shrinking of its NIM (net interest margin) and a decline in its profitability. Let\u2019s summarize interest rate risk that each financial institution currently has. To mitigate this interest rate risk, the manager of MSB would have an incentive to convert $1 million of its fixed-rate mortgages to RSAs, thereby eliminating the income gap while the manager of FFC would have an incentive to convert $1 million of its RSAs to fixed-rate assets, thereby eliminating the income gap. Let\u2019s see how the plain vanilla interest swap can help both managers satisfy their hedging needs. Suppose there is a plain vanilla interest rate swap whose NP is $1million, matures in 10 years with floating rate\u00a0[7]\u00a0of T-bill rate plus 1% and fixed rate of 7% available for both MSB and FFC. Both agree to enter into the swap contract where MSB (fixed-rate payer)\u00a0agrees to pay FFC a fixed rate of 5% on NP of $1 million for the next 10 years, and FFC (floating-rate payer)\u00a0agrees to pay MSB the one-year T-bill rate\u00a0[8]\u00a0+ 1% on the same NP for the next 10 years. As illustrated in Figure 7.1 below, under the swap contract, every year MSB is obligated to pay the fixed interest payment of $50,000 (=fixed rate of 5% times $1 million) to FFC and receive variable interest payments (to be determined at (T-bill rate +1%) times $1 million) from FFC. Therefore, as market interest rate rises in the future, the variable interest payments that MSB will receive from FFC will rise while the fixed interest payments that MSB needs to pay to FFC is fixed at $50,000, leading to higher NIM and profitability. In other words, now thanks to the interest-rate swap, MSB is now protected from interest rate risk (i.e., rate-hike) in the future. To the contrary, under the swap contract, every year FFC is obligated to pay variable interest payments (to be determined at (T-bill rate +1%) times $1 million) to MSB and receive the fixed interest payment of $50,000 (=fixed rate of 5% times $1 million) from MSB. Therefore, as market interest rate drops in the future, the interest payments that FFC will receive from MSB will be fixed at $50,000 while the interest payments that FFC needs to pay to MSB will decline, leading to higher NIM and profitability. In other words, now thanks to the interest-rate swap, FFC is also now protected from interest rate risk (i.e., interest rate drop) in the future.

Graduates of this course are well-prepared to pursue roles such as financial analysts, portfolio managers, risk analysts, or positions within financial institutions and corporations, where they can leverage their expertise in understanding market dynamics and making informed decisions to drive business growth and manage financial risks effectively. A real-world example of the application of concepts learned in Analysis of Financial Markets can be seen in how investment firms use market analysis to make decisions about stock or bond investments. For instance, when analyzing the bond market, students can apply concepts such as interest rate risk and credit risk to assess bond prices and yield curves. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, investment firms closely monitored central bank policies, interest rates, and government stimulus measures to navigate market volatility. By using tools like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or risk management strategies, students will gain the knowledge to predict market movements, manage risks, and make data-driven decisions in real-world financial markets. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Overview Unlocking Your Potential Lesson 7: Risk Management in Financial Institutions Pros and Cons of Interest Rate SwapHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsUnderstand the functioning and structures of global financial markets and assess their role in shaping corporate and institutional investing, financing, and risk-management strategies.

The dollar amount of the interest payments exchanged is based on a predetermined dollar principal, which is called the\u00a0notional principal amount (NP). The dollar amount that each counterparty pays to the other is the agreed-upon periodic interest rate times NP. The only dollars that are exchanged between the parties are the interest payments,\u00a0not the NP. As like other financial derivative contracts, an interest-rate swap is a derivative contract whose underlying assets is floating-rate payments that float with some reference rate (floating-rate payment). This party who agrees to receive/buy the underlying assets (floating-rate payment) and to pay the fixed-rate payment is referred to taking\u00a0LONG\u00a0position on the swap as the\u00a0fixed-rate payer\u00a0or the\u00a0floating-rate receiver. The other party, who agrees to pay the floating-rate payment and to pay the fixed-rate payment is referred to taking\u00a0SHORT\u00a0position on the sway as the\u00a0floating-rate payer\u00a0or\u00a0fixed-rate receiver. The period between the contract date and the last settlement date is called\u00a0term\u00a0of a swap. The most common interest rate swaps, called\u00a0plain vanilla\u00a0swaps, exchange fixed rate payments for floating rate payments.Understand the functioning and structures of global financial markets and assess their role in shaping corporate and institutional investing, financing, and risk-management strategies.

A few basic reminders, harking back to your Online Orientation: *Subject to change Web-centric or web-based applications are everywhere. We have much richer multimedia applications than ever before, which operate within the browser and mobile apps, rather than separate applications that people have to download to their PC desktops or mobile phones. The browser or the like (e.g., mobile apps)\u00a0 / server computing model will continue to be one of our mainstream programming models empowering the majority computing solutions. A web-based application is accessible over a network through the\u00a0Internet\u00a0or an\u00a0intranet. Technically, it refers to a computer software application that is largely coded in a browser-supported language (such as JavaScript, XML, combined with a browser-rendered markup language like HTML). Web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of web browsers and apps. Unlike a traditional (or proprietary) client/server model, a web-centric model enables the ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on potentially thousands of client computers, which is a key reason for their popularity. More important, from the end user\u2019s perspective, web-centric applications essentially provide computing applications with scalability and flexibility due to the inherited open system architecture, language-independence, and platform-independence. Due to the increasing growth of web-centric applications, the Internet has consolidated itself as a very powerful platform that has changed the way we do business, communicate, learn, and live. The Internet, as no other communication medium, has given an international (globalized) dimension to the world.\u00a0The Internet has become the universal source of information for millions of people, at home, at school, and at work. As a result, the traditional barriers of\u00a0time difference\u00a0and\u00a0geographical distance\u00a0get essentially eliminated. Common Web Applications Common web applications include the following: Like anything else, a web-centric application has pros and cons. Some pros and cons may switch sides under certain circumstances. This would be especially true when computing technologies evolve and security concerns become a daunting factor in organizations. Select each tab below to read about the benefits and challenges of web-based applications. Authentication is the front line to shield unauthorized access to a web application that holds confidential information. Legitimate users use a combination of credentials (e.g., username, password, and two-factor code) to log on. There are many different technologies available for developers to implement authentication mechanisms. Below is a list of popular authentication technologies used in web applications\u00a0[2]: Web Resources Please read the linked web pages above to get a better understanding of the technologies.\u00a0Although some of them may seem outdated, you might still find them adopted by many web sites. Because of design flaws and weak implementations using the above technologies, some web applications become extremely vulnerable in terms of protecting authentication attacks. For example, only about 14% of passwords used by legitimate users are considered strong. In other words, the majority of legitimate users use weak authentications due to web design flaws, weak implementations, or misuses. Pie Chart Information on Statistical Report of Passwords As seen in Figure 4.1, bad passwords are used by many legitimate users. If a web application is designed in such a way that a user can use any password the user likes, it surely has a flaw in its authentication functionality design. Common weak authentication designs and implementations include the following\u00a0[1]: The\u00a0OWASP SQL injection prevention cheat sheet\u00a0provides a set of simple techniques for preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The following techniques (extracted from this cheat sheet) can be used with practically any kind of programming language with any type of database. The following (Java) example would allow an attacker to inject code into the query, resulting in that the delivered query would be straightforwardly executed by the database. Lacking a proper input validation, the \u201ccustomerName\u201d parameter simply appended to the query allows an attacker to inject any SQL code the attacker wants. Obviously, this simple while commonly used code is extremely unsafe. (Click the tabs to learn more) The use of prepared statements (aka parameterized queries) is simple. Parameterized queries are easy to write, and easier to understand when compared to dynamic queries. Essentially, parameterized queries force developers to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter to the query later. As a result, the use of parameterized queries allows a database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied. The following code example uses a PreparedStatement, Java\u2019s implementation of a parameterized query, to execute the same database query. The above unsafe example becomes safe. Stored procedures have the same effect as the use of prepared statements. They require developers to define the SQL code first, and then pass in the parameters after. The difference between prepared statements and stored procedures is that the SQL code for a stored procedure is defined and stored in the database itself, and then called from the application. The following code example uses a CallableStatement, Java\u2019s implementation of the stored procedure interface, to execute the same database query. The \u201csp_getAccountBalance\u201d stored procedure would have to be predefined in the database and implement the same functionality as the query defined above. This third technique is to escape user input before putting it in a query. Each database management system (DBMS) supports one or more character escaping schemes specific to certain kinds of queries. If you then escape all user supplied input using the proper escaping scheme for the database you are using, the DBMS will not confuse that input with SQL code written by the developer, thus avoiding any possible SQL injection vulnerabilities. For instance, every occurrence of a single quote (\u2018) in a parameter must be replaced by two single quotes (\u201d) to form a valid SQL string literal. In PHP, for example, it is usual to escape parameters using the function mysql_real_escape_string() before sending the SQL query\u00a0[2]: In this lesson, students will learn the fundamentals of web security and privacy, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities, defending against threats, and using security tools. The course combines hands-on projects and discussions to build practical cybersecurity skills. Upon completion of this course, students will: Throughout this course offers a comprehensive journey into the world of web security and privacy.

Typically, a web browser is all that is needed on a client side. Browser applications or apps require much less disk space on the client when compared to traditional client/server applications. They typically require no upgrade procedure since all new features are implemented on the server and automatically delivered to the users; occasionally, certain browser extensions (plug-in or add-on) might be needed, for instance a newly released flash. Web applications integrate easily into other server-side web functions, such as email and searching. They also provide cross-platform compatibility in most cases (i.e., Windows, UNIX, iOS, Android, Linux, etc.) because they operate within a reconfigurable computing container. Browsers are highly capable and functional, enabling rich and satisfying user interfaces. They are readily adapted for new services-oriented computing technologies.Web applications absolutely require compatible web browsers. If a browser vendor decides not to implement a certain feature, or abandons a particular platform or operating system version, this may affect a huge number of users. Standards compliance is an issue with any non-typical office document creator, which causes problems when file sharing and collaboration becomes critical. Web applications rely on application files accessed on remote servers through the Internet. Therefore, when connection is interrupted, the application is no longer usable but if it uses HTML5 API\u2019s such as\u00a0Offline Web application caching, it can be downloaded and installed locally, for offline use. Since many web applications are not open source, there is also a loss of flexibility, making users dependent on third-party servers, not allowing customizations on the software and preventing users from running applications offline (in most cases). However, if licensed, proprietary software can be customized and run on the preferred server of the users. They depend entirely on the availability of the server delivering the application. If a company goes bankrupt and the server is shut down, the users have little recourse. Traditional installed software keeps functioning even after the demise of the company that produced it (though there will be no updates or customer service). Likewise, the company has much greater control over the software and functionality. They can roll out new features whenever they wish, even if the users would like to wait until the bugs have been worked out before upgrading. The option of simply skipping a weak software version is often not available. The company can foist unwanted features on the users or cut costs by reducing bandwidth. Of course, companies will try to keep the good will of their customers, but the user of web applications has fewer options in such cases unless a competitor steps in and offers a better product and easy migration. The company can theoretically track anything the users do. This can cause privacy problems. The users\u2019\u00a0information security\u00a0largely relies on the service providers if the service is not hosted by users themselves.Multi-factor Mechanism HTML form-based authentication HTTP\u00a0basic access authentication HTTP digest access authenticationOther GOOD passwords 14% Two characters 2% Three charcters 14% Four characters, all letters 14% Five letters, all same case 22% Six letters, lower case 19% Words in dictionary or list of names 15%Verbose authentication failure message\n\nProviding hints for legitimate users.

According to Barney & Hesterly (2010): \u201c[I]nternal analysis provides a comparative look at a firm\u2019s capabilities. Internal analysis helps a firm to determine if its resources and capabilities are likely sources of competitive advantage and establish strategies that will exploit any sources of competitive advantage. The concepts of resource and capability should be understood in order to understand how to analysis the internal capability. Resource is tangible (factories, products) and intangible (reputation) assets of a firm. Capability is a subset of resources that enable a firm to take full advantage of other resources (marketing skill, cooperative relationships).\u201d Based on our understanding of resources and capabilities, we can apply internal capability analysis methods such as SWOT, value chain analysis, or the VRIO framework to conduct an engineering management project.

In either case, there are major issues to be identified and overcome. How a business subject handled those issues generally explains its success or failure, but it is also very important to analyze specific problems and potential resolutions along with such issues. The goal of this analytical stage is to systematically and effectively identify major issues surrounding your case in relation to the outcomes of the previous analysis steps (i.e., strategic & functional analyses). Furthermore, this step deals with how to form appropriate strategic responses and actions. It is also necessary to identify possible engineering management solutions through a strategic alternatives review.

Many companies (e.g., Pandora, Facebook, Microsoft) are developing conversational bots. In the bot battles illustrated in the following video, two bots are battling against each other by making conversations for the audience to determine which one exhibits language intelligence closer to humans. They are also called conversational bots. More information on conversational bot battles is available in\u00a0this article from MediumLinks to an external site.\u00a0and in this\u00a0article from the BBC As mentioned earlier, machine learning uses algorithms and mathematical models to simulate neural networks in the human brain. We call those mathematical models that convert inputs to outputs/predictions\u00a0artificial neural networks. Nowadays, people just call them neural networks for short. But do understand that when data scientists say\u00a0neural networks, they most likely mean artificial neural networks instead of neural networks in the human brain.\u00a0Artificial neural networks are the engines of machine learning. A subset of machine learning called deep learning is based on the complexity of human neural networks.\u00a0Deep\u00a0learning\u00a0is a form of machine learning that involves complex, multilayered (and therefore\u00a0deep, which is where the name comes from) neural networks. It usually has more than two nonoutput layers. Nonoutput layers include both input layer and hidden layers, illustrated in the image here. Three Types of Data Models In this page, you will see examples for the three types of data model. Hierarchical data model looks like this: Network data model looks like this: The main difference between hierarchical data model and network data model is that for hierarchical data model, a child can have only one parent, wile for network data model, a child can have more than one parents. For example, C2 has two parents, B1 and B2. Figure 4.1 in your textbook is the example for relational data model. Compared to hierarchical data model and network data model, relational data model is more flexible in the sense that you can add tables and relationships anytime, whether it is during the model building process or after the process. This also means that you do not have to build all the relationships at the time of model creation. In this course, you will learn how to build relational database. Types of Joins A join specifies how to combine records from two or more tables in a database. There are two basic types of joins: The inner join and the outer join. Inner Join will display only the rows or records where the joined fields from both tables are equal. If we use a circle to represent a table, inner join will result in the records of the shaded areas in the picture below. Inner join is the default join type in Microsoft Access. An outer join displays all rows from one table and only those rows or records from the other table where the joined fields are equal. The shaded area in the picture below represents the results from the outer join. There are two types of outer joins. The picture above is the demonstration of left outer join,\u00a0which will include all the rows from the first (left) table. The picture below is the demonstration of right outer join, which will include all the rows from the second (right) table. Structured Query Language (SQL) In the next three Access projects, you will use SQL to answer some questions regarding database. The first two projects are group projects and the last one is an individual project. In this way, you can first learn from your peers if you have anything not understanding from the textbook. Here, I will provide some basic format of SQL you will use in the projects. The basic format is as follows (words with all capital letters in bold indicating SQL operators/clauses etc.): A developer named Laszlo Hanyecz\u00a0in Jacksonville, FL posted a message on May 18, 2010 as follows: \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas..like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I\u2019m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don\u2019t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a \u2018breakfast platter\u2019 at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you\u2019re happy! I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. Just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire. I\u201df you\u2019re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal. Thanks, Laszlo\u201d What he was trying to do is to see whether he can make a transaction using Bitcoins. Besides being a developer, he is also an early bitcoin miner. Three days later, May 21, 2010, he made another post because he has not received any pizza delivery. \u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d The very next day, May 22, 2010, he reported that he has received the pizza delivery and posted pictures. \u201cI just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.\u201d Pictures:\u00a0http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/ Thanks Jercos!\u201d This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

A few basic reminders: *Subject to change Humans live in a connected world. Everything from social media to institutions (such as a government), processes (such as an economy), and infrastructures (such as a global airline network) form a complex network. But humans are not unique in being part of an interconnected system. We see complex networks in an entire ecosystem, interacting genes and communicating neurons. Network-based perspective, therefore, has been found to be useful in the study of complex systems in: There has also been a growing interest in sciences in the recent past to move away from the reductionist approach that focused on studying fundamental parts of a complex system. A system-level perspective considers a system as more than a sum of its parts and tries to understand emergent behavior that results from the interation of these parts. For this course, our interest will be in economic, political and social interactions shaped by social networks. Social networks play an important role in trade of goods and services, how we vote, how much education we obtain, whether we become criminals or succeed professionally. The myriad of ways in which a social network affects our lives raises many important questions: We will try to answer these questions over the next several weeks during this course. Basic topographical measures such as size, average distance, and diameter provide information on a network as an aggregate, giving analysts an ability to gauge the overall potential of the network in terms of capacity and performance and also providing a context within which to interpret other measures that may come further down the analysis pipeline. Table 1 provides a summary of these measures. Network size\u00a0is simply a count of the number of actors in a network. Knowing a network\u2019s size is important when interpreting measures sensitive to it, such as density or diameter. For instance, it is meaningless to compare densities of networks that are dissimilar in size. Size can also be used to understand if a network is growing or shrinking over time. A dark network that is consistently growing is likely recruiting successfully. Analysts should be careful, however, and understand how the boundaries of a network have been defined or else they may\u00a0not\u00a0be looking at the true size of the network. Average distance\u00a0places more emphasis on the ties between actors within a network. It is measured as the average length of all the shortest paths or geodesics between all actors in a network. It provides an analyst with a means to determine how fast information can spread throughout a given network. All things being equal, networks with lower average distance should be more efficient in diffusing information and resources than those with a higher average distance. This information can be used to formulate a deception campaign strategy that relies on spreading disinformation to undermine the operations of a dark network. However, care has to be taken with the timing of such campaigns since networks are dynamic and the average distance of a network is likely to change with time. Network diameter\u00a0measures a network\u2019s longest geodesic and indicates how dispersed a network is. Networks with large diameters may be more dispersed than those with small ones. Dispersed or decentralized networks are better suited to solving complex and challenging problems while maintaining their operational security when compared to more centralized or hierarchical networks. However, since a network diameter is closely related to its size, we should be careful when comparing diameters of networks of different sizes. The basic topographical measures highlight some tradeoffs that dark networks may face and provide evidence for the potential of these networks. These relationships, however, may not be as clear cut and, therefore, these measures should, at first blush, be used just as an evidence of potential. For instance, a network with small average distance could be vulnerable to misinformation campaigns but could equally prevent disinformation from spreading among its members. The\u00a0small-world network model\u00a0was introduced by Watts and Strogatz who observed that many networks in the real world display high level of clustering with small distances between nodes. This observation cannot be explained using random network models that, despite small distances between nodes (diameter of random networks are on the order of\u00a0O(log n)), show very little clustering (clustering coefficient is proportional to\u00a0n-1). In order to create a model that closely aligned with their observation, Watts and Strogatz suggested to first create a network with a lattice structure. In this structure, first a set of\u00a0n\u00a0vertices are arranged such that each vertex is connected to\u00a0r\u00a0of its neighbors. Next, for each edge, independently and with probability\u00a0p, one end of the edge is moved to be incident on another vertex. This new vertex is chosen uniformly randomly with attention to avoid construction of loops and multi-edges. The intent is to: Figure 5 shows a lattice structure with high clustering and high diameter along with the effect of rewiring a few links. The picture is not quite what we observe in the real world but it can be used to answer questions surrounding networks where we have high clustering and low diameter.

Conflict exams: For direct conflicts with exam dates that are known in advance, a conflict exam will ONL be given to students with Penn State University approved absences (e.g., University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities, including employment interviews and religious holidays).\n\n\nYou must:\n\n\nProvide at least one week of advance notice;\nSubmit official/supporting documentation; and\n Receive permission from the Instructor prior to being approved to schedule a conflict exam.\n\n\nYour request for a conflict exam may be denied if advance notice is not provided (i.e., the Instructor is not obligated to give you a conflict exam if you fail to properly recognize and/or properly communicate your conflict with sufficient notice).\nConflict exams will be statistically similar in length and difficulty as non-conflict exams and will be scheduled at a mutually-agreeable time between the Instructor and student while remaining sensitive to integrity of the exam process. You must:\n\n\nProvide at least one week of advance notice;\nSubmit official/supporting documentation; and\n Receive permission from the Instructor prior to being approved to schedule a conflict exam. Provide at least one week of advance notice; Submit official/supporting documentation; and Receive permission from the Instructor prior to being approved to schedule a conflict exam. Your request for a conflict exam may be denied if advance notice is not provided (i.e., the Instructor is not obligated to give you a conflict exam if you fail to properly recognize and/or properly communicate your conflict with sufficient notice). Conflict exams will be statistically similar in length and difficulty as non-conflict exams and will be scheduled at a mutually-agreeable time between the Instructor and student while remaining sensitive to integrity of the exam process. Make-up exams: In those rare instances where an emergency arises immediately prior to the exam (e.g., serious illness, injury, or a family emergency), contact the Instructor as soon as possible, explain the circumstances, and submit legitimate documentation supporting your excuse. The Instructor will make a reasonable judgment in these cases, but when deciding whether or not to approve a make-up exam the Instructor will consider the nature of the emergency, the timing of notice provided, and the integrity of the exam process. The Instructor will also consider the overwhelming percentage of students who are able to make the exam at the regularly-scheduled time. If your particular situation is not deemed by the Instructor to be a true emergency (e.g., serious illness, injury, or a family emergency), then your request for a make-up exam will be denied. Accordingly, do not rely on the existence of a make-up exam policy as an excuse to miss a regularly-scheduled exam.

Much of the learning process will be based on activities such as classroom discussion and individual or group exercises. Therefore, you are expected to come to class prepared and ready to engage in the activities of the day. I will assess your participation throughout the semester. Lack of attendance may result in a loss of participation points associated with that evaluation. Late arrival and/or early departure may also result in a loss of participation points at the Instructor\u2019s discretion. The Participation grading category will consist of THREE separate evaluation points:\n\n\nOne for the first five weeks of the course;\nOne for the second five weeks of the course; and\nOne for the last five weeks of the course. One for the first five weeks of the course; One for the second five weeks of the course; and One for the last five weeks of the course. Each evaluation point will consist of two components:\n\n\nAn objective assessment worth 50% of the overall grading category: The objective component will be based on observed in-class participation, which is inherently different for each person. As I get to know you, I will also get to know your style of engagement. For some students, this will involve volunteering responses to questions being asked of the group during class. For other students, remaining engaged may involve the manifestation of a different learning style. Regular attendance and remaining engaged in the daily activities and/or classroom discussion in a manner that remains consistent with your learning style is the key to earning the objective Participation points.\nA subjective assessment worth 50% of the overall grading category: By contrast, the subjective component will be based on my personal assessment of your overall level of participation in the course, given the opportunities provided throughout the academic term. This may include my personal assessment of your level of attendance*** and in-class engagement, and this may also include my personal assessment of whether you took advantage of course resources such as office hours, if needed.

This three-credit course prepares students to evaluate a firm\u2019s equity securities within the financial markets, providing a solid foundation in valuation techniques suited to diverse scenarios such as financial distress, private enterprises, and start-ups with limited earnings. Through a combination of in-depth readings and hands-on activities, this course integrates key concepts from accounting, financial analysis, and quantitative methods. Students will explore the interplay between financial statements, monetary policy, and market operations, gaining a holistic perspective on how these factors influence equity valuation. The course also delves into managerial effectiveness, risk management strategies, and global market operations\u2014essential elements in assessing firm value. The primary deliverables for BUSAD 885 include comprehensive equity valuation analyses using real-world scenarios and case studies. By the end of the course, students will have developed the skills to apply advanced valuation techniques, interpret the implications of market regulations, and identify strategies that enhance value creation. Upon completion, students will be well-equipped to produce high-quality equity valuation reports, empowering them to make informed investment decisions and pursue advanced roles in finance and equity analysis. BUSAD 585 focuses on the analysis and valuation of a firm\u2019s equity securities in the financial market using fundamental and market multiples analyses. The course integrates topics discussed in previous finance courses to help students develop their analytical ability to identify corporate strategies that enhance value creation. The philosophical basis for this topical integration is that the valuation of a firm\u2019s securities requires one to know not only the accounting issues involved in the preparation of financial statements and how to analyze financial statements but also to understand the impact of monetary policy, as well as the operation and regulation of financial markets on the value of the firm\u2019s equity securities. Moreover, because firm value depends on how well the company is managed, a good understanding of its operations in the global markets, its internal control, and risk management strategy is also essential. Finally, because valuation is also based on quantitative models, knowledge of quantitative methods is paramount.

Students\u2019 prior exposure to accounting, economics, quantitative methods, and Excel modeling will be instrumental in learning the material in this course. Familiarity with business strategy is also useful. The motto in this course is \u201clearning by doing,\u201d not \u201clearning by watching.\u201d Most of the learning in this course occurs through the application of the methodology in class discussions, case analyses, and the final project. To this end, the instructor will serve mostly as a facilitator and will be available to provide general guidance. A grade is given primarily on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment. Students are encouraged to seek the instructor\u2019s input during the process of completing each course requirement. Students are reminded that a letter grade of A is given to students who do exceptional work in both the quality of communicating ideas/information and the level of scholarship demonstrated, not simply for completion of assignments or meeting minimal requirements set for assignments. *Student work will be graded according to the following grading scheme: A = 94-100, A- = 90-93.99, B+ = 87-89.99B = 84-86.99, B- = 80-83.99, C+ = 77-79.99, C = 70-76.99, D = 60-69.99, F = Below 60 Note: The Scholarship and Research Integrity (SARI) Ethics Assignment is ungraded. Even though this assignment is not graded, the submission of this assignment is still mandatory for final grade release. The maximum possible total score earned in the course is 150. At the end of the course, the total course score is determined as a percentage of the maximum possible total score of 150. Decimal points for this percentage score will follow the normal convention of rounding up or down. For example, a percentage score of 93.3% will be rounded down to 93%. Then, the letter grade will be determined by converting your percentage score above using the scale below. Students will be asked to participate in ongoing online activities and discussions. Students should refer to the course schedule to view the required deadlines for discussion forums, which will be graded based on the criteria listed in the course rubrics. Even though this assignment is not graded, the submission of this assignment is mandatory for final grade release. The purpose of this assignment is two-fold. First, it is intended to familiarize students with the Chartered Finance Analyst (CFA) Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Ethical Conduct, in particular those standards that are relevant to preparing, presenting, and disseminating information related to investment analysis and recommendations. This ethical training further complements the University\u2019s Scholarship and Research Integrity (SARI) requirements. The second objective is to refresh your skills in using YouSeeU in preparation for the final project presentation. For the SARI Ethics assignment, your group will select a topic from the Chartered Finance Analyst (CFA) Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Ethical Conduct. There are four parts to this project, including: *Additional instructions for the SARI Ethics Assignment can be found within the corresponding lesson material (Lessons 4 and 5). There will be a total of five (5) homework assignments that are required to be completed as individual work. Please check the course schedule to see when the homework assignments are due and which exercises are required to be completed for each homework assignment. You need to complete these assignments using Excel. Additionally, your work will be graded based on the criteria listed in the course rubrics. It is very important that you complete and submit all the homework assignments in order to master the materials, keep up with the course progress, and do well in the course. The objective of this project is to analyze a firm\u2019s historical performance, to identify, recognize, analyze, and understand the firm\u2019s strategies that lead to shareholder value creation or destruction, and to place an economic value on the shareholders\u2019 claim in the publicly-traded company of your choice using the valuation techniques developed in class. The guidelines for this project are divided into two parts: Historical Performance Analysis and Company/Stock Valuation, which are discussed in more detail in the\u00a0Specific Guidelines\u00a0section found in the course modules. The project will be completed in groups and is due at the end of Week 6 of the course (please check the course schedule for the due date). Please form a group of three (3) or four (4) members, including yourself. Please select your group members and notify the instructor of your selection of group work and group members by the end of the first week. For group work, each group member will be required to submit a peer evaluation form to evaluate her/his groupmates, but not herself/himself. Although the project is not due until the end of Week 6, a suggested timeline is provided for your groups to follow that will assist you with time management, but it is up to your group to decide on a final approach. In general, any manufacturing and retail publicly traded company listed on the NYSE, ASE, or NASDAQ is eligible. Companies discussed in previous classes (e.g., Walmart. Target, Costco) are\u00a0not\u00a0to be chosen. Each group must choose a different company. Avoid financial services (e.g., banks, insurance) and multi-divisional companies (e.g., GE) at this time. Valuing these types of firms is conceptually more difficult. As a start, your group may want to look at a company in which you have great interest (maybe you own its stock, work in the company, and have stock options, or whatever). Alternatively, you may want to look at a company that is doing very well or very poorly. Your group will need to choose a company by no later than the end of Week 2 and inform the course instructor. Reports will be evaluated on both the quality of the analysis as well as the effectiveness of the communication. Constructive use of tables and graphs is encouraged; extensive sensitivity analysis or\u00a0Monte-Carlo\u00a0simulation without a concrete interpretation is not encouraged. The report should\u00a0not\u00a0exceed 20 double-spaced typewritten pages,\u00a0including\u00a0tables or graphs. You should use a 12-point font and 1-inch margins on each side. There is a format suggestion draft document as well as the principles that the report should conform to available to students in the course. Additionally, students can also refer to the\u00a0Specific Guidelines\u00a0document in the course, as it will provide information in regards to how your analysis should be conducted and how the report will be graded. The report is due at the end of Week 6. To assist students with group discussions, a group discussion forum will be set up so that only the members of each group can access their group discussion forum as a means to communicate. Feel free to use the forum as often as you need to when completing the final project. You can also use other means of communication with your group, such as Collaborate, Skype, e-mail, phone, etc., whichever communication tool works best for your group. Each group is to present its analysis and findings associated with the Company/Stock Valuation by the end of Week 6 so class reviewing can be completed in Week 7 (please check the course schedule for the due date). The presentation should not be technical or too detail-oriented. The idea is to highlight the company\u2019s overall strategy and how it relates to firm value. Your classmates and the instructor will view and evaluate your presentation. Treat your classmates as fellow equity research analysts or portfolio managers, who are eager to hear what you have to say about the company that you cover. The presentation should not take more than 30 minutes. Each group will complete one presentation and it should be submitted using YouSeeU. As a reminder, all students will need to access the YouSeeU site to be automatically enrolled in the BUSAD 585 YouSeeU course space. Each group member will then complete their video recording of their assigned section using YouSeeU. Once the video is completed, you will then need to sync your PowerPoint slides with your video recording.\u00a0Note:\u00a0Each group member will be able to see each member\u2019s presentation and accompanying slides for each section of the presentation. Once all group members\u2019 videos and slides have been uploaded, any of the group members can designate the order of the videos. Presentations are due by the end of Week 6 so class viewing may begin in Week 7. Presentations will also be viewed via YouSeeU. group presentations will be graded based on the completion of the presentation evaluations and the peer evaluations of group members. See each of those sections for more information. Finally, after your group has completed the Final Project Report and Presentation, each member will need to complete a peer evaluation\u00a0each group member. The grading criteria for the Final Project Peer Review can be found in the grading section. Each student is required to view and evaluate each of the recorded group presentations other than their own using the\u00a0Final Project Presentation Evaluation form in the course. The recorded group presentations will be viewed through YouSeeU and will include PowerPoint slides. Your participation in viewing and evaluating the group presentations will count towards the individual final project presentation evaluation grade. Please keep in mind that since there are no assigned readings or lecture notes for Week 7, the review, evaluation, and discussion of group presentations will serve as the lesson for the last week of class. The evaluations are due at the end of Week 7. Individual student ratings for the group presentations will not be disclosed by the instructor to any other students in the course.\u00a0Please Note:\u00a0Each student needs to submit this presentation evaluation form, evaluating each group presentation, and an entry response is required for ALL fields on the form. The score from each presentation evaluation form will then be averaged to indicate the peer review of the presenting group by the non-presenting students. The final presentation evaluation score for the presenting group will be based on the weighted average of the student peer review/evaluation (80%) and the instructor\u2019s evaluation (20%). Please make sure you add the name of the presenting group and/or company being evaluated in the evaluation form. Group Assignment (Reviewing Team) Please keep in mind that since there are no assigned readings or lecture notes for Week 7, the group presentation review, discussion, and evaluation will serve as the lesson for this last week of class. Each group will be assigned one group that they need to review by 3 a.m. Wednesday. After the reviewing group has completed their review of the assigned presenting group, the reviewing group will also need to compose a question for the assigned presenting group and post it to the discussion forum by creating a new thread by 3 a.m. Wednesday. Please see the table in the Final Project description page found on the Canvas Syllabus page\u00a0for the group assignments.\u00a0Note:\u00a0The schedule may need to be modified after the instructor finalizes group selections at the end of Week 1. Any changes will be communicated to students as soon as they are finalized. After the non-presenting group has completed their review of the presenting group and composed their question, one member from the non-presenting group should post the question to a new thread within the discussion forum by 3 a.m. Wednesday. Group Assignment (Presenting Team) The presenting group will then need to post a response to the reviewing group\u2019s question by 3 a.m. Friday. After the presenting group has answered the question of the reviewing group, one member from the presenting group should post the answer to the thread in the discussion forum. The group discussions will be graded based on the criteria listed in the Final Project Discussion Grading Rubric. Individual Assignment (Optional) Students will be able to review all questions posted by reviewing groups and the responses posted to the questions by the presenting groups in the Final Project Discussion Forum. Students are encouraged but are not required to individually participate in the discussion after the presenting groups have posted their responses.\u00a0*Note: This is an ungraded assignment. *subject to change Let\u2019s take a look at another use of ratio analysis: assessing the likelihood of bankruptcy. To assess the likelihood that a firm will go bankrupt, we can use the methodology developed by Altman (1968).\u00a0[23]\u00a0In his paper, Altman constructed a composite score called the\u00a0Z\u00ad-Score\u00a0as follows: Equation 1.1.: The value in front of each ratio on the right-hand side of the\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0above represents\u00a0each ratio\u2019s weight (coefficient) in the formula.\u00a0\u00a0Note that the first four ratios on the right-hand side of the\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0equation need to be expressed as a percentage, not a decimal\u00a0number.\u00a0For example, if the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio is 0.257, it has to be stated as 25.7. The last ratio, Sales to Total Assets, is expressed as a decimal. For example, Sales to Total Assets ratio of 1.45 is stated as 1.45, not 145. Note also that other publicly searchable sources may show different weights than those in the above formula.\u00a0You should not be alarmed by the difference as it has to do only with the switch between percentage and decimal.\u00a0For example, other sources may use 1.2 as the weight for Working Capital to Total Assets ratio.\u00a0When this is the case, the ratio should be expressed as a decimal number. Although several of the five ratios that make up the\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0formula may not look familiar to you, they are related to the ratios discussed in ACCTG 512. For example take a look at each of the ratios and their meanings in the table below. Except for the market value of equity, other variables that make up the\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0can be extracted from the company\u2019s financial statements in any given year.\u00a0 The calculation of\u00a0Z-Score, given the definition of five ratios contained therein, is straightforward. How do we use the\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0formula to assess the likelihood of bankruptcy? To help with this task, we can use the following criteria: Example: Enron Now, let\u2019s apply the above criteria to an actual company, Enron.\u00a0 As everyone knows, Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001.\u00a0 For each year over the 1995 \u2013 2000 period, Enron\u2019s\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0is given below.\u00a0[24] Note that in each year from 1995 through 1998, Enron\u2019s\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0was below 1.81. There was an improvement in\u00a0Z-Score\u00a0for 1999 and 2000, but it was still below what could be considered a respectable score. In relative valuation, we use price multiples to estimate the value of an asset. In the case of stocks, price multiples are simply ratios of stock price to a standardized measure of value such as earnings per share, book value of equity per share, or sales per share. Because relative valuation involves estimating the market price of an asset by using information available for comparable (similar) assets, the valuation process requires us to do the following tasks (see Damodaran\u2019s notes cited in the readings list for this lesson): The straightforward part of task a) above is obtaining market values. As we are dealing with stocks of publicly traded companies, we can get the stock prices from the Wall Street Journal, Value Line, Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or other sources. Identifying the comparable assets is trickier. How should an analyst identify comparable companies? Should the companies be chosen from the same industry as the company being analyzed? Even if companies from the same industry have been chosen, many companies have several lines of businesses. In this case, should the analyst look at the line of business based on the highest revenue generated, the greatest investment in asset, or the highest profits? One could also argue that defining comparable companies using industry or line of business classification is too narrow because companies with similar growth, cash flow, and risk characteristics could be considered comparable companies as well. There is no clear-cut solution to this problem.\u00a0 Nevertheless, analysts typically use industry or sector classification. Task b) is accomplished by dividing market price with a common variable across comparable assets, such as earnings, book value of equity, revenues, cash flows, or some other industry-specific variable. Creating price multiples requires that both the numerator and denominator are variables for the same claim holders in the firm. This requirement implies that if the numerator is the price of common stock, then the denominator must be a variable that is directly related to the common stockholders. Also, because stock price is stated on a per share basis, the common denominator must be stated on a per share basis as well. For example, P/E ratio is the ratio of the market price of common stock to earnings per share (EPS). It is also important to note that the common denominator variable must be measured in the same way. Take EPS as an example, should we measure it based on the most recent EPS, or future (expected) EPS? What if the company has no net income (hence, zero EPS or negative EPS in the case of net loss)? In addition, what about the effect of accounting practice used by the firm on EPS (e.g., the effect of FIFO versus LIFO on EPS)? The key here is to be consistent in the measurement of the variables used in the ratios. Once tasks a) and b) have been completed, we need to make a judgment about the asset\u2019s over or undervaluation by comparing its price multiple with the price multiples of comparable assets. Making a comparison without controlling for any possible firm-specific differences would be na\u00efve. For example, suppose the P/E ratio of firm A\u2019s stock is 30, while that of firm B\u2019s stock is 10. Can we tell which stock is \u201cexpensive\u201d or \u201ccheap\u201d by simply comparing their P/E ratios without controlling for firm-specific differences? Thus, task c) requires us to understand the drivers of the price multiples so that justifiable comparison can be made. When forecasting a company\u2019s performance, a financial analyst needs to develop a set of assumptions about the company\u2019s future outlook. Developing a reasonable set of assumptions requires one to assess the firm\u2019s historical performance within the context of its industry and economic environments. This task represents the most critical and challenging part of any valuation exercise because the future is unlikely to be the same as the past. When performing this task, it is important to remember that: As such, conducting a valuation analysis requires one to ask the following questions: The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation (see BUSAD 826 or Lesson 4) requires you to compute the asset\u2019s (i.e., stock or firm) value as: Equation 3.1. This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week. This lesson serves as the cornerstone for the course, focusing on the foundational link between a company\u2019s strategic decisions, its financial performance, and the valuation of its equity.

BUSAD 885: Research in Security Valuation equips students with advanced analytical and valuation skills that are essential for careers in finance, investment analysis, and corporate strategy. By mastering techniques such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, Relative Valuation, and Monte Carlo simulations, graduates are prepared to tackle complex challenges in equity research, portfolio management, and financial consulting. The course\u2019s emphasis on ethical standards, strategic frameworks, and data-driven decision-making ensures that students develop a well-rounded skill set that is highly valued in the industry. Graduates who have completed this course often pursue roles such as Equity Research Analyst, Financial Analyst, Valuation Consultant, and Portfolio Manager. The comprehensive approach to security valuation combined with hands-on applications makes BUSAD 885 an excellent steppingstone for professionals aspiring to work at investment firms, financial advisory companies, or corporate finance departments. A real-world example of a security valuation challenge can be seen in the retail industry. A private equity firm was evaluating a publicly traded retail company for potential acquisition. The company appeared undervalued in the market, but its historical performance was inconsistent due to shifting consumer trends and supply chain disruptions. The firm needed to determine whether the company\u2019s current market price reflected its intrinsic value or if it was a worthwhile investment opportunity. Initially, the valuation relied heavily on basic market multiples, which failed to account for the company\u2019s evolving business strategy and external economic factors. This resulted in an incomplete analysis that undervalued potential growth opportunities, such as expansion into e-commerce and partnerships with third-party logistics providers. Recognizing the limitations, the firm enlisted a valuation expert trained in techniques such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Residual Income (RI) analysis. The expert conducted a detailed historical performance analysis, identifying key drivers of value creation, such as the company\u2019s competitive pricing strategy and strong customer loyalty. They integrated sensitivity and scenario analyses to account for uncertainties in market conditions, using Monte Carlo simulations to test various growth and risk scenarios. Additionally, the valuation incorporated qualitative assessments of industry trends and economic forecasts to refine assumptions. This thorough approach revealed that the company\u2019s intrinsic value was significantly higher than its current market price, supported by robust growth prospects in e-commerce and operational efficiencies. The firm successfully acquired the company, and within two years, the investment yielded substantial returns, driven by strategic growth initiatives. This example underscores the critical role of effective security valuation techniques, as taught in BUSAD 885, in making informed investment decisions and maximizing shareholder value. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Final Project Report and Presentation Unlocking Your Potential Course Structure Framework for Forecasting PerformanceHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsAnalyze the firm\u2019s financial statements and compare them to industry and key competitors; Recognize, analyze, and understand the firm\u2019s competitive advantage within the domestic and global markets, as well as corporate strategies aimed at the creation, transfer, and destruction of shareholder value; Develop financial projections consistent with the firm\u2019s core competence and strategies within its operating environment; and Provide an integrated perspective of the firm\u2019s valuation in the marketplace.Lundholm, R., & Sloan, R.

The instructor will post a question prompt to the discussion forum each week to get the discussion started, but will have minimal participation in the discussions, other than monitoring the discussions throughout the duration of the course. During the semester, each student must post at least\u00a0one original post (five points)\u00a0related to an accounting or finance event. The topic should be related to financial reporting, one course topic, or corporate finance (corporate governance, insider trading, ethics, etc). A qualified original post should be independent from the posts already in the forum,\u00a0start with an accounting or corporate finance event identified in the financial press, proceed with your summary, and end with a thought-provoking question. No more than five points are earned by original posts. The original post should begin with a headline:\u00a0Original Post:\u2026\u2026 Students are also required to post at least\u00a0three\u00a0valid replies (one point each, three points at most) in total in this forum by the end of the semester to get the participation credit. A valid reply contributes positively and meaningfully to the discussion of the current topic. No more than three points are earned as replies. An example of a valid reply is your own thought supported by data and/or facts. An example of an invalid reply is a simple \u201cYeah.\u201d, \u201cLOL.\u201d, or \u201cI agree.\u201d There are assignment problems for each lesson that will be completed on an individual basis. These problems come from the problems of each chapter in the textbook and will correspond to the required readings for each lesson. These problems will not be graded. However, it will be beneficial for you to complete these as they will prepare you for quizzes and course projects. There will be a short, graded quiz for you to complete after each of the lessons, which will cover the content of lessons, assigned textbook readings, and associated problem assignments. To facilitate the understanding of the statement of cash flows, students will answer a series of questions based on Wal-Mart\u2019s\u00a0statement of cash flows for the latest fiscal year. To facilitate the understanding of assessing earnings quality, students will use the techniques discussed in the textbook and online course content to assess Wal-Mart\u2019s earnings quality. There is one team-based project that is due at the end of the course (please check the course schedule for the due date). Although the project is not due until the end of the course, it would be beneficial for your team to begin working on the project as early as possible during the course. You are strongly encouraged to form a team of four to six. The purpose of this project is to help you gain further understanding of the knowledge learned in this course by analyzing real-world data and making investment decisions. After your team has completed the Final Project Assignment, one member of your team should submit your team\u2019s presentation (Word and PowerPoint files) to the drop box by the due date listed in the course syllabus. Please use the following naming convention when submitting your team files to the drop box and include your team name in the subject of the message (e.g., ACCTG512_FinalProject_Team1). Additionally, your team will need to complete a 20-25 minute video recording of your entire presentation and upload it to Bongo. Your team will need to determine each team member\u2019s role for the presentation. Each team member will then complete their video recording of their assigned section using Bongo. Once the video is completed, you will then need to upload your PowerPoint slides and sync them with your video recording.\u00a0Note:\u00a0Each team member will be able to see each member\u2019s presentation and accompanying slides for each section of the presentation. Once all group members\u2019 videos and slides have been uploaded, any of the group members can designate the order of the videos.\u00a0Note:\u00a0You will have an opportunity to access the ACCTG 512 class space at Bongo and complete a practice assignment during the first week of the course (this activity will be completed individually). Since you will be working in a team for this assignment, the instructor will assume that everyone contributes equally and assign the same score to each team member, unless written complaints are received that the teamwork has been unfairly distributed. In this event, the team has to submit a group evaluation sheet indicating each member\u2019s contribution. This evaluation should assign a percentage of the project score that each team member deserves. Although, teams have the responsibility of resolving any conflict that may arise. In the event conflict cannot be resolved, the team can fire the non-contributing member. To be fair to the fired team member, he/she (and the instructor) need to be notified at least a week before the project\u2019s due date. The fired team member will then have to complete the project individually. *subject to change Now we\u2019ll talk about some issues with expense recognition. The first one is\u202fbad debt expense. Bad debt expense can significantly impact the amount of net income, which is used to achieve value from performance. The accounting rule is that at the time of sales, sellers have to estimate the uncollectible amount on the basis of the historical experience or industry norms. The amount is recorded as bad debt expense offsetting recorded sales and allowance for doubtful accounts offsetting the recorded\u00a0amount\u00a0of accounts receivable in the balance sheet. The second special case is\u202fwarranties. The accounting rule states that at the time of the sales, sellers are required to estimate the amount of future original manufacturers\u2019 warranty expense. The recorded warranty expense would depress recorded sales. There is also a need to record future warranty liability simultaneously. This accounting recognition of future expense and future liability as current items at the times of sales will depress net income and increase the amount of liability in the balance sheet at the same time. Managers have substantial control of the amount of estimated bad debts and estimated warranty expense. In this lesson we will devote our discussion to analyzing inventories. First, let\u2019s go over the multiple-step income statement. Companies report products being held prior to sale as inventory, which is a current asset on the balance sheet. When the products are sold, the cost of the inventory becomes cost of goods sold in the income statement. The cost of goods sold is then subtracted from net sales to reach gross profit, the first metric of profitability. Additional expenses are subtracted subsequently to calculate net income. The valuation of inventories impacts the calculation of gross profit directly. Manufacturers must account for three types of inventories: They can either report the total value of the inventories in the balance sheet and disclose in the footnotes the separate carrying values of those three types of inventories or, they can report those items directly in the balance sheet. Retailers have only one type of inventory. Figure 8.1. illustrates how a retailer reports cost of goods sold and net income. A bond contract is also known as a bond indenture. Bond issuers collect cash from investors when the amount of capital needed is too large for one lender to supply. The paybacks of bonds include two streams of future cash flows: Bonds (by default, we refer to commercial bonds, or bonds issued by public firms) typically carry a $1,000 face value with semiannual interest payments. Note that the quoted interest rates are normally annual rates. So, if you want to calculate the interest amount, you must divide it by two to get the semiannual interest amount Now one of the reasons firms issue bonds is that the amount of needed capital is too large for any one lender to supply. Some industries, such as telecommunications or manufacturing, are very capital intensive. Firms in those industries need a lot of cash to fund investment projects, to acquire fixed assets, etc. So, their capital needs normally are huge, and they typically go to capital markets and issue bonds to raise capital.

ACCTG 512: Financial Accounting Theory and Reporting Problems equips students with the analytical and technical skills essential for navigating complex financial reporting landscapes. This course provides a deep dive into the principles and practices that govern financial statement analysis, tax accounting, inventory valuation, and employee compensation reporting. These competencies are vital for careers in accounting, finance, and auditing, where precision, compliance, and strategic decision-making are critical. Professionals who master the topics covered in ACCTG 512 are well-suited for roles such as Financial Analyst, Accounting Manager, Compliance Officer, and Tax Accountant. This course\u2019s focus on real-world application and problem-solving prepares graduates to meet the challenges of financial analysis, regulatory reporting, and organizational decision-making, making them valuable assets across various industries. A real-world example of financial accounting challenges occurred when a multinational retail company faced issues with its inventory valuation method. The company had been using the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) method for its U.S. operations, while its international divisions employed the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method to comply with local regulations. This inconsistency created challenges in consolidating financial statements and confused investors, as the cost of goods sold (COGS) and ending inventory values varied significantly between regions. The problem was compounded during a period of inflation when the LIFO method in the U.S. resulted in lower reported earnings compared to the FIFO method used abroad. This discrepancy led to misunderstandings about the company\u2019s profitability and financial health, causing a temporary decline in investor confidence. To address this issue, the company engaged financial accountants and analysts to assess the impact of switching to a uniform inventory valuation method across all divisions. After conducting a thorough analysis, including evaluating tax implications and regulatory compliance, the company transitioned to the weighted average method globally. This change improved financial statement consistency, enhanced transparency for investors, and facilitated better decision-making at the executive level. This example highlights the critical importance of understanding inventory valuation methods, their financial statement impact, and the role of financial accounting professionals in resolving complex reporting challenges. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 11: Accounting for Employee Compensation Unlocking Your Potential Section 2.3: Expense Recognition Retailer Cost Structure for Gross Profit and Cost of Goods SoldHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsAnalyze an organization\u2019s financial statements.

Most work in NLP \u2013 which has both theoretical and applied elements \u2013 is aimed at making computers understand text and identify meaningful information and eventually improve the relationship between computers and basic language. NLP encompasses approaches to help machines understand, interpret, and generate human languages. For this reason, NLP is sometimes described as natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. The illustration in Figure 7.1 below shows the text generation from trained n-gram language model given the initial context including a sequence with one word (e.g., \u201cI\u201d). The next step is to generate the probability distribution given the word \u201cI\u201d, and then randomly get a sample (e.g., \u201cwas\u201d) from the distribution. The sample will be appended to the sequence and become the current context (i.e., \u201cI was\u201d). These steps are repeated and the new sequence becomes \u201cI was happy\u201d . Figure 7.1: Text generation (credit: Elena Voita ) Deep learning has played a critical role in the rapid growth of automatic speech recognition (ASR). The task of automatic speech recognition is to convert spoken language into computer-readable text. Due to the variety of speech sounds that humans are capable of producing, ASR is tightly coupled with computational linguistics and phonetics. In ASR, digitized speech signals are converted into computer-readable text, referred to as transcripts. Basically, ASR involves mapping audio samples to a sequence of words representing the transcript (Figure 12.1 below). Figure 12.1: automatic speech recognition (ASR) vs text-to-speech (speech synthesis) This course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

What is Ethics? Ethics is based on accepted standards of behavior.\u00a0 These standards stem from a variety of sources including religious writing, philosophical thought and the influence of community values. The ethical standards of accounting are influenced by the practices of those in the profession, state laws, board of accountancy rules and the expectations of society. Norms, Values and the Law: Ethical decision making follows well-established norms of behavior involving our values, the laws and ethical obligations. The values of the accounting profession are embedded in its code of ethics. The laws create a minimum set of standards. When the facts are unclear and the legal issues are uncertain, an ethical person acts on the basis of established standards of ethical behavior. The Golden Rule is a consistency principle which prescribes that we should treat others the way we want to be treated. In ethical decision making, the process we follow (means) to decide on a course of action is more important than achieving the end goal or results. The Auditing Standards Board released a standard on audit risk assessment, SAS No. 145 to improve risk assessments and enhance audit quality.\u00a0 The guidelines are intended to enable auditors to better understand internal controls, address the risk associated with the use of information technology, and determine risks of material misstatement.\u00a0 The standard includes guidance on maintaining professional skepticism. The release for SAS No. 145 is available at\u00a0\u00a0AICPA.org. Section AU-C 315 directs the auditor to perform risk assessment procedures to provide a basis for the identification and assessment of the risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the financial statement level through the understanding of the entity and its environment.\u00a0 To obtain an understanding, the auditor may consider the industry, regulatory and other external factors, the nature of the entity, the objectives and strategies and related business risks and the measurement and review of the financial performance of the company. Section AU-C 330 instructs the auditor to design and implement responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the financial statement level.\u00a0 The assessed risks may affect the types of audit procedures to be performed and their combination. Management may commit fraudulent financial reporting for being under pressure from sources outside or inside the company to achieve an expected earnings target or financial outcome. Examples of risk factors include competition, rapid changes, decline in customer demand, threat of bankruptcy, negative cash flows, rapid growth and new accounting requirements. A perceived opportunity to commit fraud may exist if an individual believes internal controls can be overridden. Opportunities to engage in fraudulent financial reporting can arise from significant related party transactions, ability to dominate a certain industry sector, estimates that involve subjective judgments, complex transactions and operations across jurisdictional borders. If an individual possesses an attitude, character or set of ethical values that allows the individual to knowingly and intentionally commit a dishonest act, the individual may have the ability to rationalize the committing of a fraudulent act. Financial statements are expected to present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. AU-C 200: The financial statements are prepared and presented by management with oversight from those charged with governance. AU-C 700: In order to form an opinion, the auditor needs to obtain a reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error. AS 3101 Reports on Audited Financial Statements: According to the PCAOB Standards, the correction of a material misstatement in previously issued financial statements should be recognized in the auditor\u2019s report by the addition of an explanatory paragraph.\u00a0 The addition should include a statement that the previously issued financial statements were restated to correct the misstatement in the respective period and a reference to the company\u2019s disclosure of the correction of the misstatement.

The firm\u2019s internal auditors identified discrepancies in the financial records but faced pressure from senior management to overlook these irregularities. This created an ethical dilemma, as the auditors had to choose between adhering to professional standards and risking retaliation or losing their jobs. To address this, an ethics consultant trained in professional responsibilities and ethical accounting practices, similar to those studied in ACCT 550, was brought in. The consultant reviewed the company\u2019s internal controls, engaged with the audit team, and reinforced the importance of adhering to the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. They implemented a whistleblower policy to protect employees reporting unethical behavior and recommended improvements to the firm\u2019s governance structure. As a result, the firm restated its financials, initiated a culture change promoting ethical leadership, and regained trust from its stakeholders. This example highlights how applying ethical principles in accounting can resolve conflicts, enhance transparency, and uphold public trust. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 13: Ethical Leadership in Accounting Unlocking Your Potential Required Textbook 11.1 Financial StatementsHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsUnderstand ethical decision-making Distinguish between right and wrong conduct Uphold integrity as a fundamental trait of character Identify potential issues of conflict Gain confidence in maintaining your professional values\u201cA\u201d (Excellent) indicates exceptional achievement. \u201cB\u201d (Good) indicates substantial achievement. \u201cC\u201d (Satisfactory) indicates acceptable but substandard achievement. \u201cD\u201d (Poor) indicates inadequate achievement and is a failing grade for a graduate student.Ethical Leadership in Accounting Foundations of Ethics Application of Ethical Reasoning in Accounting Ethical Decision-Making Processes Ethical Organization Environment Corporate Governance Systems AICPA Code of Professional Conduct Tax Services/PCAOB Rules Fraud in Financial Statements Auditor Responsibilities Accountant and Auditor Liability Statutory Liability and International Standards for Auditors Earnings Management/Creative Accounting Earnings Management Devices/Financial RestatementsEthics in Accounting Fraud In Financial Statements Financial StatementsIncentives/Pressure Opportunity RationalizationProfessional codes of conduct and ethical standards in accounting.

You will have to choose a period in that final week when you can devote up to 2 hours. *subject to change \u201cSubclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.\u201d To state it another way: A user of a base class should continue to function properly if a derivative of that base class is passed to it.\u00a0 Read about Liskov\u2019s\u00a0Substitution Principle.* You might think that this is the advantage of inheritance \u2013 that a client can have a reference to any instance of any derived class of the base class it expects, but as has been mentioned several times in this course already, we don\u2019t (usually) get type conformance by default\u2026i.e. inheritance does not ensure substitutivity. By the way, this principle is named for Barbara Liskov and I\u2019ve included an article of hers in the Handouts folder that you should read. It provides the formal foundation of the principle. Consider function,\u00a0foo(B& b).\u00a0If I send a reference to an instance of class\u00a0D\u00a0derived from\u00a0B\u00a0to function\u00a0foo\u00a0the compiler will accept it and it wont create a runtime error, but it might not work as I hoped. If\u00a0D\u00a0causes\u00a0foo\u00a0to misbehave,\u00a0D\u00a0is\u00a0fragile\u00a0in the presence of\u00a0foo. To avoid that problem we might resort to run-time type information, but this still violates LSP and now also OCP. void DrawShape(const Shape& s){if (typeid(s) == typeid(Square))DrawSquare(static_cast(s));else if (typeid(s) == typeid(Circle))DrawCircle(static_cast(s));} As you can see from the timeline, frameworks develop from experience and start life as white-box frameworks utilizing inheritance. The persistence framework was an example of a white-box framework through its use of template and factory methods. As the framework evolves the elements within it are decomposed, regions of variation are identified (Pree\u2019s hotspots) and isolated, and composition and delegation are used in place of inheritance so that those fine-grained elements can be combined by the application developer as needed. Read about each pattern in detail, including the problem it solves, the rationale and context, and the solution and its implementation in the original article here. The creational patterns are all concerned (unsurprisingly) with object creation. Most of them provide ways to create objects without knowing exactly what you\u2019re creating beyond the interfaces supported by the created objects. By the end of this course, students will be able to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

A hospital wanted to implement a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to improve patient care and reduce manual administrative tasks. However, the stakeholders (doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients) all had different needs, and there were also strict regulations to comply with. The requirements were poorly defined and communicated, leading to a software product that did not fully meet the needs of its users, was difficult to use, and failed to comply with all necessary regulations. This caused delays in patient care, an increase in administrative tasks, and potential regulatory fines, highlighting the consequences of poorly executed software requirements engineering. To address this, a requirements engineer was brought in to thoroughly define and communicate the system requirements. The engineer worked closely with all stakeholders to understand their unique needs, and carefully examined the regulatory standards. This led to a comprehensive and clear list of requirements that served as a guide for the software developers. With this, the EHR system was redesigned to meet all user needs, was user-friendly, and fully compliant with regulations. The successful implementation of the revised EHR system dramatically improved patient care, reduced manual tasks, and ensured regulatory compliance, illustrating the significant real-world impact of effective software requirements engineering. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Dominare Fundamenta Incertitudinis Modulationis Unlocking Your Potential Course Requirements and GradingHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsModule 1: Introduction to Data Structures, Algorithms, and Python Module 2: Data Structures and OOP Module 3: Recursion and Searching Module 4: Trees and Algorithms Module 5: Hash Tables and Graph AlgorithmsUnderstand fundamental data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and trees) and their applications in solving computational problems.

Inventory sales between the companies must be recorded. The seller records revenue, and the buyer enters the purchase into its accounts. For internal reporting purposes, recording an inventory transfer as a sale/purchase provides vital data to help measure the operational efficiency of each enterprise. From a consolidated perspective, an intra-entity transfer is the internal movement of inventory that creates no net change in the financial position of the business combination taken as a whole. In producing consolidated financial statements, transfers are eliminated. Consolidated statements reflect only transactions with outside parties. The entire impact of the intra-entity transfer must be identified and then removed.Both parties record the transfer in their internal records as a normal sale/purchase. In the consolidated financial statements, all intra-entity inventory transfers must be eliminated. A consolidation worksheet entry, TI, will remove the resulting balances from the externally reported figures. Cost of Goods Sold is reduced under the assumption that the Purchases account usually is closed out prior to the consolidation process.

All assignments will be accepted up to one week late\u00a0with a late penalty (10% per day).\u00a0No homework is accepted after the late period. *Subject to change In the emerging age of big data, it is not uncommon for the terms data visualization, scientific visualization, information visualization and infographics to be used interchangeably. While there are no hard and fast rules that delineate the classification of these visualization types, let\u2019s examine how data scientists generally view the relationship between these visualization categories. First,\u00a0data visualization\u00a0is generally used as an umbrella term under which other visualization categories fall. As Stephen Few (2009) summarizes: \u201cI use data visualization as an umbrella term to cover all types of visual representations that support the exploration, examination, and communication of data.\u2018Whatever the representation, as long as it\u2019s visual, and whatever it represents, as long as it\u2019s information, this constitutes data visualization\u201d. Next, let\u2019s consider some\u00a0key sub-categories\u00a0that fall under the data visualization domain including\u00a0information visualization\u00a0and\u00a0scientific visualizations. Stuart Card (1999) defines visualization and the sub-categories of scientific visualization vs. information visualization as follows: Data Visualization:\u00a0\u201cThe use of\u00a0computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognitition.\u201d\u00a0( p. 6) (Click the tabs to learn more) Scientific visualizations focus on visualizing measurable scientific data or complex simulated data that can be mapped to coordinate system (e.g., statistical graphs and charts). This includes scientific data mapped onto spatial coordinates associated with real-world objects that can be used to help explain observed scientific phenomenon. Examples of such domain specific visualizations include medical imaging, business intelligence, or geographic information systems. (See Figure 1.2) Information visualization corresponds to the visualization of more abstract data that may lack inherent spatial components. Such abstract data is ultimately processed into a more tangible form that can be readily understood by others. Examples include network analysis where relationship data is mapped to a network form so patterns and relationships in complex datasets can be readily identified. Examples include social networks, metabolic networks and internet communication. (See Figure 1.3) In visualizing a whole, we are interested in seeing how its individual parts compare relative to each other. Since a whole represents 100% of something, all its individual parts must add up to 100%. The simplest way to visualize a whole and its parts is through a pie chart. Figure 6.2 shows a breakdown of orders that are shipped at a company (Superstore). \u201cHow Do We Ship Our Orders?\u201d is the question we are trying to explore here. Each wedge on the pie chart (see Figure 6.2) is labeled to indicate the type and percentage of the shipping mode. The circle represents the whole and is proportionately carved out into wedges that represent its part. Since a complete turn about a circle is 360 degrees, the percentage value of each wedge is calculated as a ratio of its angle to 360 degrees. For example, a 90-degrees wedge would represent 90/360 or 25% of the whole. All wedges add up to 360 degrees or 100%. Often times pie charts have been criticized since people have trouble judging proportions from angles of wedges. However, a simple pie chart properly labeled and not overcrowded with wedges can be quite useful. Here the output obtained from the script provided in Table 13.2 is omitted. Students are encouraged to execute the scripts in Table 13.2 and interpret the output. Let us now visualize the selected 3D image. Here it is important to remember that many image viewers, such as matplotlib\u2019s\u00a0imshow, are only capable of displaying 2D data. To visualize the 3D image, we will fix one axis and still use the\u00a0imshow\u00a0function to display the grayscale 2D images using different views (see Figure 13.1). The script for viewing the different views of the 3D image is provided in Table 13.3. As discussed above, a 3D image can be viewed as a series of 2D planes (image). Table 13.4 provides a helper function,\u00a0display, to create a montage of several planes. By default, every other plane is displayed (see Figure 13.2).

This course investigates the profound and diverse ethical challenges arising from the rapid integration of AI into various aspects of human life Through curated readings and dynamic discussions, the course examines how AI systems challenge existing moral frameworks and highlights the need to redefine or establish new paradigms to address these concerns. Students will grapple with critical issues such as threats to privacy, freedom, and economic justice, as well as broader implications regarding race and gender equality. As AI systems evolve and exhibit higher levels of intelligence, the course delves into pressing questions about their moral agency, responsibilities, and potential rights. Using a combination of theoretical and practical approaches, this course equips students with the philosophical tools necessary to critically analyze the ethical implications of AI systems. Discussions are grounded in key concepts from ethics and philosophy of mind, supported by a growing body of literature in the field. Upon completing the course, students will be well-prepared to engage in informed debates, apply ethical reasoning to real-world AI challenges, and contribute meaningfully to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. AI is the use of machines to do tasks that seem to require human intelligence and cognitive skills (thinking, natural language, inference, decision making etc.) The Ethics of AI is the young branch of applied ethics that seeks to study the far-reaching and diverse ethical issues that arise with the widespread and rapid integration of AI technologies into various aspects of our lives. The challenge is that we are in an uncharted ethical territory with regard to AI: we need to radically adjust our existing ethical paradigms or introduce new ones as we experience and acquire a better grasp of the problems involved in AI-human interaction. A large portion of these issues reflect our concerns about the harm that the use and misuse of AI might cause for humanity. Such issues range from threats to individual privacy and freedom to wider social implications regarding economic justice and race and gender equality. However, as AI systems develop and attain higher levels of intelligence, questions about their moral status become more pressing. If these systems are capable of moral agency, then not only do they have responsibilities towards other moral agents like us, but they also have rights that we should respect in our conduct towards them. This course aims to provide an overview of the nature and extent of the ethical issues arising from AI-human interaction as well as the necessary philosophical background (particularly, in ethics and philosophy of mind) to develop an informed methodology in approaching these issues, with the help of the flourishing literature on the subject. At the end of this course, you will be able to: There are no required textbooks for this course.

This collaborative assignment is designed to encourage team-based problem-solving, practical application of normative reasoning, and creative thinking. Components Details At the end of this course, you will be able to: *subject to change Ethics of AI\u00a0is a young subfield of\u00a0applied ethics, which is the branch of ethics focusing on the study of ethical issues that arise in various venues of life, such as medicine, business, environment, technology, etc. There are three philosophical branches of ethics as shown in the image below. Applied ethics\u00a0involves the application of ethical theories and principles to real-life cases, and thus, requires a theoretical background. The major portion of philosophical ethics that deals with such theories is called\u00a0normative ethics. Normative ethics offers different theories aiming to answer substantive questions such as \u201cwhat is good?\u201d, \u201cwhat is the right thing to do?\u201d, and \u201cwhat is a good person?\u201d Metaethics, yet another field of philosophical ethics, inquires into the very nature of statements that employ predicates such as \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and \u201cbad\u201d. The primary objective of the first two lessons is to provide you with the necessary theoretical background for a philosophical and systematic approach to the ethical issues specific to the use of AI in our lives. We will survey the prevalent metaethical positions on the nature of moral qualities and judgments as well as major normative theories of the good. In this first lesson, we will focus on metaethics and two such normative theories: consequentialism and deontology. Systematic discriminatory practices are generally rooted in biases, which consists of prejudices, stereotypes, and preconceptions about members of a group. While biases as mental states or beliefs are of interest to various fields of study, including psychology, cognitive science, and epistemology, they are particularly relevant to applied ethics when they inform or influence impactful decisions about individuals. A decision or judgment about a person is biased and thus unfair, if the decision maker was influenced, negatively or positively, by a characteristic of that person (such as race, gender, or sexual orientation) that is irrelevant to the issue in question (for instance, how the person would perform at a job, whether they could pay their loan back, or stay reasonably healthy for the next five years), regardless of whether the decision itself turns out to be accurate or not. Of course, bias is fundamentally a human phenomenon. The somewhat intuitive expectation would be that delegating important decisions to machines and algorithms that operate on numbers, formalisms, symbols, and lack intentionality (as John Searle insisted, for instance, as we saw in lesson 4) and good or bad values would remove human biases. For such systems would just be neutral about the skin color or gender of the data subjects, which, in turn, would translate into objective and fair outputs. It is, however, quite na\u00efve to think that technology can remain immune to human injustices. Not only are new algorithms introduced into a society with \u201cold systems of power and privilege\u201d, and historically established race, gender, and class inequalities, but they are also produced within such a social-political context and with the data resulting from or reflecting the existing inequalities.[1] There are substantial reports and studies revealing that AI-powered machines or algorithms can perpetuate and even deepen biases toward historically marginalized groups. Take, for instance, gender bias in hiring, which has been a known social phenomenon in job markets. But moving the decision power from humans, who might be gender biased even if implicitly, to AI does not necessarily address the problem. Amazon scrapped an AI recruiting tool that it had been developing once it was realized that the tool was biased against women.[2] Another avenue where AI algorithms are widely used is loan applications. It has been reported that algorithms determining the credit score or creditworthiness of individual applicants are biased against people of color.[3] Propublica revealed that COMPAS (The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), the algorithm assessing the risk of prisoners committing future crimes or reoffending (\u201cpredictive recidivism\u201d) and thus informing their parole decisions is biased against African-Americans.[4] Similarly, \u201cpredictive policing\u201d algorithms used to decide how much police force to allocate to urban areas are reported to be biased against neighborhoods of color.[5] It has also been shown that facial recognition systems tend to work more accurately for subjects that are male and with lighter skin.[6] Bias is a preference one has for or against a person or a group, or an idea, a thing, a belief, generally considered to be prejudicial and unfair. There are different kinds of biases we will examine, including: [1]\u00a0Eubanks, Virginia 2017,\u00a0Automating Inequality.

The\u00a0deontological\u00a0approaches to privacy regard it as a\u00a0right. As we saw in lesson 1,\u00a0deontology\u00a0or\u00a0duty ethics\u00a0construe the rights of individuals as generating\u00a0duties\u00a0for others to respect and not violate those rights. For instance, my right to a certain property or land generates the duty for other people not to trespass, unless I permit them to do so. One philosophical challenge with regard to rights is to justify them by offering explanatory answers to questions such as \u201cwhy is X a right?\u201d or \u201cwhat makes X a right?\u201d This challenge applies to the claim that privacy is a right as well. We have a strong moral intuition that privacy matters and that it should be respected by others, but it is not all obvious why that is the case. One might argue that it is a social convention, which can change or lose importance depending on contingent and empirical facts about the era we live in. One might also argue that privacy is just an obsession that we are all psychologically conditioned to have.

Graduates of this course often find career opportunities in roles such as AI Ethics Specialist, Data Privacy Consultant, Technology Policy Analyst, and Responsible AI Officer. These positions are available across sectors, including tech companies, government agencies, healthcare, and non-profits. By combining technical knowledge with a deep understanding of ethical principles, this course positions students at the forefront of ensuring AI technologies are designed and deployed responsibly. One real-world example of an ethical issue in AI can be seen in the hiring process. A multinational corporation implemented an AI-powered recruitment tool designed to screen job applications and identify top candidates. The tool used historical hiring data to learn patterns and preferences. However, the historical data contained biases, as previous hiring practices disproportionately favored certain demographic groups. As a result, the AI system began systematically disadvantaging candidates from underrepresented groups, perpetuating existing inequalities and leading to accusations of discrimination. To address this issue, an AI ethics specialist was brought in to evaluate the system. They identified the biases in the training data and highlighted the ethical implications of using such a system without proper oversight. Working closely with data scientists and HR professionals, they re-engineered the AI tool to remove biased data and incorporate fairness metrics. Additionally, the company implemented transparency measures, such as explainable AI features, to ensure stakeholders could understand and trust the system\u2019s decisions. The revised recruitment tool not only improved diversity in hiring but also enhanced the company\u2019s reputation for ethical practices. This example demonstrates the critical importance of addressing ethical considerations in AI, ensuring these technologies are fair, transparent, and aligned with societal values. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 14: Singularity, Superintelligence, and Transhumanism Unlocking Your Potential The Moral Relevance of PrivacyHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsValue: Included in the Writing Assignments category (30% of total grade).

The insights gained from this course into cloud computing, middleware, DevOps, and data management will position you as a valuable asset to organizations looking to optimize their technological capabilities and adapt to evolving business environments. One real-world example of a contemporary information system architecture problem can be seen in the retail industry. A large multinational retailer sought to modernize its e-commerce platform to handle increasing customer demands, improve inventory management, and integrate online and in-store systems. However, the existing system was built on a legacy architecture that lacked scalability, had limited integration capabilities, and was prone to frequent downtime during peak shopping periods. These issues led to poor customer experiences, lost sales opportunities, and inefficiencies in inventory management. To address this challenge, the company embarked on an architecture redesign project. A team of systems architects was brought in to evaluate the existing infrastructure and design a scalable, cloud-based architecture that leveraged middleware to integrate e-commerce, inventory, and supply chain systems seamlessly. The new architecture also incorporated modern data analytics tools to provide real-time insights into customer behavior and inventory levels.

This course equips students with the tools and methodologies to identify and implement optimal solutions for complex engineering problems, considering both constrained and unconstrained scenarios Through selected readings, interactive lectures, and hands-on exercises, the course explores the foundational concepts of optimization, including defining objectives, decision variables, and constraints. Students will delve into optimization methods, such as optimality criteria and search techniques, to solve real-world engineering challenges. A particular emphasis is placed on linear programming and the application of the Simplex algorithm to efficiently handle problems with linear constraints and objectives. Practical skills will be developed using industry-standard tools like MATLAB\u2019s Optimization Toolbox and Excel Solver. These platforms enable students to solve both theoretical and practical optimization problems, from simple graphical methods for two-variable systems to complex multi-variable, nonlinear problems encountered in modern engineering. The primary course deliverables include problem-solving exercises using advanced optimization techniques and software, as well as comprehensive projects that integrate theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Upon completing this course, students will be proficient in designing and implementing optimization solutions that address the complexities of systems engineering. Engineers face problems involving making decisions. They have to pick the \u201cbest\u201d from a list of alternatives. This requires a clear definition of the objective and the ability to clearly express it in terms of the decision variables. A thorough understanding of the problem and a detailed description are necessary to define the performance parameters that are needed to specify the objective function. The design variables can be either controllable or uncontrollable. We set the uncontrollable variables to meaningful values and write the objective function in terms of controllable variables. Lastly, we need to define the constraints. They could be the equality or the inequality types. Having clearly defined the optimization task, we solve the problem and determine the design variables that will yield the optimum solution. Finding the best solution to a problem is a basic human desire. In this process, one may or may not encounter problems with restrictions or constraints which makes them either constrained or unconstrained sets, respectively. There are two basic approaches scientists use to solve these problems: optimality criteria methods and search methods. In the optimality criteria approach, a set of conditions has to be satisfied at the optimal point. In the search technique, a solution set, say a design, is hypothesized and improved upon until an optimum set is found that satisfies any optimality criteria. In this course, we will address both of these methodologies. When the number of variables is two, graphical methods are possible to obtain the optimum design variables. In practice, engineers face situations that involve hundreds of design variables, and the objective function and the constraint equations are generally nonlinear in nature. With the advent of powerful computers and sophisticated computer programs like Matlab and Excel, it is possible to solve practical problems without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. The optimization toolbox available in Matlab provides a very user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and makes the solution process much easier. We will start with unconstrained optimization in which there are no constraints and extend the concepts to constrained optimization. The optimality conditions assume that we are at an optimum point and at that point these conditions are to be satisfied. Some of the conditions are necessary and some of the conditions are sufficient. We will discuss situations when they are necessary and sufficient. Linear Programming problems are a class of problems in which the objective function and all the constraints are linear. This is a very popular and practical approach that is applicable to many real-world problems. The Simplex algorithm developed by George Dantzig in 1947 is a very popular and powerful algorithm for linear programming problems. We will learn the detailed procedure for both the one-phase and the two-phase Simplex algorithm. The optimization toolbox is available in Matlab and will be used extensively throughout the course. We will also use the solver capabilities in Excel. *Note:\u00a0All students are expected to have a working knowledge of Matlab and Excel and an understanding of mathematics at the undergraduate engineering level. The mathematics needed for the course will be quite basic and will be reviewed as needed. You will also be expected to use our online discussion forums, chat rooms, and electronic mail on a regular basis. The most important prerequisite of all, however, is your interest in the course, motivation, and commitment to learning. *SYSEN 520 or instructor\u2019s permission After completing the course, a student will be able to: In this course, we will use\u00a0MATLAB, which is available for free via Penn State WebLabs.\u00a0\u00a0Instructions for accessing MATLAB can be found in the course modules. ***If you have any issues accessing GlobalProtect or PSU WebLabs, please contact the\u00a0\u00a0IT Service Desk\u00a0for assistance.

Proctored Exams \u2013\u00a0None Note:\u00a0A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment (see the Penn State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin). The following grading system applies to graduate students: Students are reminded that simply meeting the minimal requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content and presentation) will result in a letter grade of \u201cB\u201d or less for that assignment. There will be discussion forums for students to discuss among themselves different aspects of the course, and the instructor will participate in the discussions when it is appropriate. You are encouraged to work together on homework assignments. Use these discussion forums to post your questions and to read the responses from your classmates. You will be assigned homework problems every week. It is very important that you complete and submit all the homework assigned in order to master the materials and keep up with the course schedule. All assignments (homework, exams) for each week must be submitted to the appropriate assignment in Canvas before 11:59 PM EST on the following Sunday (see Course Schedule below for exact dates) for the submission to be considered on time. There will be two exams (one midterm exam and one final). Exams are on an individual basis. Any questions on exams should be directed to the instructor, who will add information to the exams if many students are experiencing particular problems. *subject to change The definition of optimization, according to\u00a0Dictionary.com\u00a0is: \u2014 Dictionary .com Performance maximization\u00a0and\u00a0lowering costs\u00a0are among the reasons for a business to seek optimization. Optimization should not be done as an afterthought but it should be integrated into every phase of the design process. If not done properly it could have a detrimental effect on the performance parameters.Extreme caution should be taken before drastically changing the design variables. We will discuss this in detail throughout this course. First, we will review some of the necessary mathematics. This procedure involves multiplying the constraints by\u00a0vivi\u00a0; the Lagrange multiplier and adding it to the objective function. In addition to taking first derivative of the function with respect to the design variables, the procedure involves taking the first derivative with respect to the Lagrange multiplier and set them to zero. This is a way of converting the constrained problem into one that we already know how to solve. Mathematically, we can write the problem as follows: Minimize\u00a0f(x)f(x)\u00a0, subject to\u00a0hi(x)=0,i=1hi(x)=0,\u2009i=1\u00a0to p. Next, we construct the Lagrange function\u00a0L(x,v)=f(x)+\u2211pj=1vjhj(x)=f(x)+vTh(x)L(x,\u2009v)=f(x)+\u2211j=1pvjhj(x)=f(x)+vTh(x)\u00a0. At\u00a0(x*,v*)(x*,v*)\u00a0, the gradient of L is\u00a00, or\u00a0\u2207L(x,v)=0\u2207L(x,v)=0\u00a0evaluated at\u00a0(x*,v*)(x*,v*)\u00a0. Differentiating L with respect to v, will recover the constraint equations. Let us illustrate the use of Lagrange mulitplier using the following example. Minimize\u00a0f(x)=x12+x22f(x)=x12+x22\u00a0subject to\u00a0h1(x)=2\u00d71+x2\u22122=0h1(x)=2\u00d71+x2\u22122=0 The Lagrange function\u00a0L(x,v)=x12+x22+v(2\u00d71+x2\u22122)L(x,v)=x12+x22+v(2\u00d71+x2\u22122) \u2207L(x,v)=\u23a1\u23a3\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u2202f(x)\u2202x1\u2202f(x)\u2202x2\u2202f(x)\u2202v\u23a4\u23a6\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5=\u23a1\u23a3\u23a2\u23a2\u23a22\u00d71+2v2x2+v2x1+x2\u22122\u23a4\u23a6\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5=0\u2207L(x,v)=[\u2202f(x)\u2202x1\u2202f(x)\u2202x2\u2202f(x)\u2202v]=[2\u00d71+2v2x2+v2x1+x2\u22122]=0 This results in three equations in 3 unknowns.\u00a0x1=\u2212v;x2=\u2212v/2;x1=\u2212v;\u2009x2=\u2212v/2;\u00a0and\u00a0\u22122v\u2212v/2=2\u22122v\u2212v/2=2\u00a0or\u00a0v=\u22124/5v=\u22124/5\u00a0. This leads to\u00a0x1=4/5\u00d71=4/5\u00a0and\u00a0x2=2/5\u00d72=2/5\u00a0and\u00a0f(x)=(4/5)2+(2/5)2=4/5 In general the objective function can be either maximized or minimized. The constraints can be combinations of greater than, equal, or less than types. The standard form can be assumed in different ways. In this course we take the objective function to be of the minimization type and the constraints are all of the equality type. Further, the design variables are all non-negative. This is convenient and is used to describe the Simplex method which will used to solve the linear programming problems. The standard form can then be written as: Minimize\u00a0f(x)=\u2211ni=1cixif(x)=\u2211i=1ncixi\u00a0subject to\u00a0\u2211ki=1aijxj=bi\u2211i=1kaijxj=bi\u00a0;\u00a0bi\u22650bi\u22650\u00a0, i=1 to m and\u00a0xj\u22650xj\u22650\u00a0, h=1 to n. In the matrix form: Minimize\u00a0f(x)=cTxf(x)=cTx\u00a0, subject to Ax=b;\u00a0b\u22650b\u22650\u00a0and\u00a0x\u22650x\u22650\u00a0.

By a time series plot, we simply mean that the variable is plotted against time. Some features of the plot: Any time series can be expressed as a combination of cosine and\u00a0sine\u00a0waves with differing periods (how long it takes to complete a full cycle) and amplitudes (maximum/minimum value during the cycle). This fact can be utilized to examine the periodic (cyclical) behavior in a time series. A periodogram is used to identify the dominant periods (or frequencies) of a time series. This can be a helpful tool for identifying the dominant cyclical behavior in a series, particularly when the cycles are not related to the commonly encountered monthly or quarterly seasonality A time series plot follows. We see a regularly repeating pattern that seems to repeat about every 30 or so time periods. This may not be surprising. The stimulus was applied for 16 time periods (of 2 seconds) and not applied for another 16 time periods (of 2 seconds). So, we might expect a repeating pattern every 16+16 = 32 time periods. The series is\u00a0n\u00a0= 128 values of brain cortex activity, measured every 2 seconds for 256 seconds. A stimulus, brushing of the back of the hand, was applied for 32 seconds and then was stopped for 32 seconds. This pattern was repeated for a total of 256 seconds. The series is actually the average of this process for five different subjects. The periodogram shows a dominant spike at a low frequency \u2013 It\u2019s hard to judge the exact location of the peak. It would help to print out the first few values of the periodogram and the frequencies. The first 16 scaled periodogram values and frequencies follow. The peak value of periodogram is the fifth value, and that corresponds to a frequency of 0.0312500. The period for this value = 1/0.0312500 = 32. That is, it takes 32 time periods for a complete cycle. This is what we expected! Threshold models are used in several different areas of statistics, not just time series. The general idea is that a process may behave differently when the values of a variable exceed a certain threshold. That is, a different model may apply when values are greater than a threshold than when they are below the threshold. In drug toxicology applications, for example, it may be that all doses below a threshold amount are safe whereas there is increasing toxicity as the dose is increased above the threshold amount. Or, in an animal population abundance study, the population may slowly increase up to a threshold size but then may rapidly decrease (due to limited food) once the population exceeds a certain size. Section 5.4 of the text covers threshold models and includes a nice example. In this lesson, we\u2019ll discuss the example and provide the R code. The series for the example is monthly rates of deaths due to flu in the United States for 11 years (n = 132). Due to the epidemic nature of the flu, the behavior of the series is quite different when the rates go above some threshold value than when it\u2019s below the value. The first step (always) is to plot the data. Following is the time series plot of the data. Note!The period of steep increase (and decrease). The authors also note a slight downward trend so examined first differences.\u00a0 Following is the time series plot of first differences. Consistent with the original data, we see sharp increases and decreases in certain periods. After some experimentation the authors decided to use separate AR(4) models for two regions: data following a first difference greater than or equal to .05 and data following a first difference less than .05. The model fit well, as evidence by the following plots \u2013 the ACF and PACF of the residuals and a plot comparing actual first difference to predicted first differences.\u00a0 In the plot comparing actual and predicted values, the predicted values are along the red dashed line.

If you discover such remarks, please notify me immediately, and I will personally address the source of those remarks. *Subject to change There are two ways to examine probability of some random events: Statistics\u00a0(empirical classical probability) Probability\u00a0(a priori classical probability) Probability model is an\u00a0idealized\u00a0conception of how reality works. For example, when I roll a fair die, each of the six faces is equally likely to occur, which indicates the probability of the occurrence of each number is 1/6. On the other hand, statistics tells us how we use a\u00a0sample of data\u00a0to calibrate our probability model. Using the die example again, if the probability of the occurrence for each face is difficult to determine, we can roll the die many times to count the proportion of times each face came up. We can then approximate the probability of the each face by using its corresponding proportions. In the above experiment, the outcome of rolling a die is unknown and in statistics, we call such an uncertain outcome as a\u00a0random variable. A random variable is usually denoted by\u00a0X\u00a0where one specific outcome is denoted by\u00a0x. In the example of rolling a die, the random variable,\u00a0X, can take a value from 1 to 6. If there are only a finite number of distinct values of a random variable, it is called a\u00a0discrete random variable. Examples of discrete random variables include the number of children in a family, the Friday night attendance at a cinema, the number of defective light bulbs in a box of ten. However, in the stock market, a stock\u2019s price is also a random variable, but unlike the outcome of rolling a die, it has many more outcomes. If we cannot count the possible outcomes of a random variable (it has infinite number of outcomes), it is called\u00a0continuous random variable. Examples include height, weight, the stock returns in percentage, and the time required to run a mile. The set or list of all possible values of a discrete random variable, with their associated probabilities, is called the\u00a0probability distribution\u00a0(denoted by\u00a0p(x)). For a continuous random variable, the probability function is denoted by\u00a0f(x) and is called the\u00a0probability density function (pdf). Let\u2019s assume that you toss two coins in the air and let\u00a0X\u00a0be the number of times heads comes up. What is the probability distribution? Obviously,\u00a0X\u00a0is a discrete random variable. We can draw a histogram of the number of heads after the toss, shown below: According to the definition of the probability distribution function, we can calculate\u00a0p(x): Table 1.2. Probability Distribution Function Note that\u00a0p(x) has two key properties: If you want to know the probability of a set of outcomes rather than a single outcome, you need to analyze the\u00a0cumulative distribution function\u00a0(cdf). Cdf is represented by\u00a0F(x)=P(X\u2264x)F(x)=P(X\u2264x), which means the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a particular value\u00a0x. In the example of rolling a die, if we want to know the probability of a side facing upward that is less than or equal to\u00a03(i.e.,\u00a0F(3)=P(X\u22643))3(i.e.,\u00a0F(3)=P(X\u22643))\u00a0, we need to add the probabilities of\u00a0X\u00a0= 1, 2, and 3. Therefore,\u00a0F(3)=p(1)+p(2)+p(3)=16+16+16=12F(3)=p(1)+p(2)+p(3)=16+16+16=12\u00a0. Example 1.1b Let\u2019s do an experiment by tossing a fair coin four times. Let\u00a0X\u00a0= # of times heads is the outcome. What is the probability function and\u00a0F(2),\u00a0F(3)? What is the probability of having heads 3 or more times? The outcome of four tosses is a sequence of heads and tails such as Head-Tail-Tail-Head (HTTH). There are 16 possible outcomes in all. The following figure lists these outcomes along with the value of X for each outcome. A reasonable probability model says that the 16 outcomes are all equally likely; that is, each has a probability\u00a01/16. Note: It is easier to relate the concept of probability function to the\u00a0relative frequency distribution. The following graph shows the frequency distribution of the number times heads occur. The probability of each outcome is just the relative frequency under such an outcome. Similarly, you can relate the concept of cdf to the concept of relative cumulative frequency. The number of heads\u00a0X\u00a0has possible values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. These values are not equally likely. As the above figure shows,\u00a0X\u00a0= 0 can occur in only one way, when the outcome is TTTT. So\u00a0P(X=0)=1/6. The outcome\u00a0X\u00a0= 2, on the other hand, can occur in six different ways, so that P(X=2)=(count\u00a0of\u00a0ways,\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0X=2\u00a0can\u00a0occur)\u00f716=6/16=3\u00a0/8.Therefore, the probability function can be computed and the results are listed below (you are encouraged to compute and confirm these results): According to the definition of CDF, F(2) = P(X \u2264 2) = p(0) + p(1) + p(2) = \n        \n\n1\n16\n\n\n        + \n        \n\n4\n16\n\n\n        + \n        \n\n6\n16\n\n\n        = \n        \n\n11\n16\n\n\n        . Similarly, you can get F(3) = P(X \u2264 3) = \n        \n\n15\n16 The probability of having 3 or more heads\u00a0P(X\u22653)P(X\u22653)\u00a0can be computed in two ways. First, by the definition of the probability function, we sum\u00a0p(3) and\u00a0p(4), which gives us\u00a0P(X\u22653)=5/16\u00a0. Alternatively, we know from the introduction of the probability function that the total probability (the probability of all the possible outcomes) is equal to 1. Therefore,\u00a0P(X\u22653)P(X\u22653)\u00a0can be obtained by using the following calculation: A mutual fund\u2019s return level and its corresponding probabilities are shown in the following table: Let\u2019s try to answer the following questions in the video below: Refer to the worksheet named\u00a0Example 2\u00a0located within the\u00a0Module 1 Examples, which contains the observed data. In this example, we will demonstrate the concept of probability and cumulative probability density functions. Here we have one example of mutual funds. We know that the different levels of the returns and its corresponding probabilities. So we want to compute what is the probability of a mutual fund that has 9% of return? And then what is the cumulative density function that the return level is less than 9%? The last question is, what is the probability of the funds earning between 3%, 7 percent? So by looking at this table here, we see that if we want to use the random variable x to represent the return level, and that this is definitely a discrete random variable. If you remember from the lecture notes that the discrete random variable has a finite number of outcomes. So in this case, x will only have four different possible values. That\u2019s why it is a discrete random variable. So in order to answer the first question, if the return level is 9%, we have to check if there is one return level that equals 9%. But obviously there\u2019s not one. So because this is a discrete random variable and we have the confidence to say there\u2019s no return levels corresponding to 9%. That\u2019s why for the first question, the probability of X equaling 9 percent is 0. So this is the answer for the first question. The second question, what is the probability of return that is less than 9%? So this is a little bit different from the first question, because although there\u2019s no return level, that\u2019s exactly equal to 9 percent, There\u2019s definitely some returns that are below the 9% level. For example, a percent, 6%, 4. So if you remember from the lecture notes, the cumulative density function of 9% equals to the probability of the random variable is less than or equal to 9%. So which translates Because of this, is a discrete random variable. We can actually enumerate other possible values. So this equals to the sum of the probability x is equal to 4 percent plus the probability x equals 26 percent, plus the probability of X equals to 8 percent, which you can find the corresponding probabilities. So for x equals to 4 percent is 0.2 probability and 0.4 plus 0.24 gives you the total probability, which is 0.84. So this is the answer for the second question. The third question is just a little bit trickier than the first two questions. It actually asks you what is the probability that the return levels between 3%? So 3% is less than or equal to the return level and then less than or equal to 7%. So in order to answer this, we know that we can easily compute the probability that X is less than or equal to 7%. All right, but we definitely want to exclude the part that is below 3% return level. So you want to minus the probability that X is less than or equal to 3 percent. So you basically exclude the part that does not belong to this range here, 3%, 7. And again for 7% cumulative attributions level, you can, by looking at a table similar to the second question. We know that 6% 4 return level is below the 7% return level. So you can compute this first part equals to this part, equals to the probability X equals to four plus the probability X equals six. The only two outcomes that have a return level is less than seven. And then you\u2019ll return level that is x below 3%. So by looking at the table here, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s no return that is lower than 3%. So you\u2019ll get a conclusion. Is this value here. This value here goes to 0. So u minus the 0, and it gives you the result equals to 4 percent is 0.26% is 0.4, and this equals 0.6. Okay? So I hope by solving this problem, you have a better understanding on the probability of discrete random variables and also its corresponding cumulative density functions. In order to accurately and objectively estimate the population parameter, we need some sampling schemes to sample the data. There is typically a trade-off between cost and accuracy. Some sampling schemes are cheaper and easier to administer, whereas others cost more but provide more accurate information. \u00a0We will not take much space here to discuss the trade-offs (but you need to be aware of them). Simple random sampling\u00a0is the simplest type of sampling scheme. Consider a population of size\u00a0N\u00a0and suppose we want to sample\u00a0n\u00a0units from this population. The simple random sampling has the following property: to randomly select\u00a0n\u00a0number from the data, every number set with a size of\u00a0n\u00a0has the same probability of being chosen. Simple random samples are the easiest to understand.\u00a0Sampling error\u00a0is defined as the difference between the observed value of a statistic and the quantity it is intended to estimate in order to measure the accuracy of the statistic obtained from the sample. In the following video, we illustrate a simple random sample example manually by using the Excel sampling function, Rand() and the data analysis add-in (the data is provided in the worksheet named\u00a0Example 1\u00a0found in the\u00a0Module 3 Examples\u00a0 Excel template). So in this example, I\u2019m going to demonstrate how to do a simple random sampling. So we have a population of 40 families with their annual incomes listed here. And I would like to randomly select 10 families and use their income as a sample to represent population parameters. So I\u2019m going to calculate the mean and the median and the standard deviation of both population and sample to compare them. Let\u2019s see how off there. So I\u2019m going to introduce two different methods to do simple random sampling. The first method is by using the Excel rand function. So here we have these 40 different families. So first, I just copy these 40 different families to hear outright. Basically you reproduce everything here. And then under a separate column, what you want to do is type in r a, n, d parentheses. This is a random number generator provided by Excel. It just provides you a random number between 01. So you populate this function to the whole list of families. So the next thing you want to do is because every time you do some operations, this number would change. It will change while you do some operations. So what you want to do is right now you copy the whole list of the random number and you want to paste values. So when you paste values, the values are now fixed. So basically you associate a random number ways one family. And this number has been fixed. The number will not be changed. All right, so remember you want to randomly select 10 different families. So how are you making sure that these 10 families are randomly selected? There are no systematic errors in it. So what you want to do is you can highlight these different columns. And you want to do a sort. And you want to sort by random number. You can either do the value from smallest to largest or you can do the largest to the smallest. It doesn\u2019t matter. So long as you are sorted by the random number. I\u2019ll right click OK. So now the first 10 different families will be the one you are randomly choosing. So this is the first way to do that. And remember, the reason you want to randomly sample from population is you want to get the parameters from the sample. So first of all, in order to compare the statistic from the sample and the population parameters. That\u2019s first because this is the same population. We have only 40. It\u2019s easy for us to calculate the mean and the median and the standard deviation. So mean equals two for the population average of the whole populations. And the mean, if you remember, Excel, has a function called a median. All right, so the standard deviation, because the standard deviation for the whole family is equal to STDEV. And you want to use STDEV dot P. P stands for population. If you remember the degree of freedom we talked about in Module 2. So you\u2019ll want to use that standard deviation STDEV dot py to calculate the population standard deviation. So this gave me the whole population standard deviation. Now, let\u2019s calculate the mean of the first sample we got here. So this equals to the average. So the first ten different family incomes. And you see they are different. The reasons they are different is so obvious because here, this is so-called statistic is the number you get from the sample in order to estimate those population mean. And obviously there are different. But later, when we talk about the sampling error and the confidence interval, you will know that you can use this statistic you got from it from the sample to estimate the population mean. So next, median equals to median of the sample. And again, it\u2019s different from the population median. Finally, the standard deviation is equal to, now, because this is a sample, it\u2019s not a population anymore. So we use STDEV. You can either just type in STDEV. By default, a calculates the sample standard deviation or you can use STDEV dot S. S stands for sample. Calculate the standard deviation. You see the standard deviation from the sample is also different from the population standard deviation. All right, so we\u2019ve finished the first method of getting the simple random sampling. So next, we\u2019re going to use another method to get a simple random sampling. This method is using the data analysis package provided by Excel. So in order to use this package, you need to first install it. So if you click this file and then go to Options, and then you go to Add-ins. As you could see at the bottom here you have Excel Add-ins. So you click Go. And then you want to make sure that this first box is checked Analysis ToolPak. So if you click okay, then it should just take a few seconds for Excel to install it. To see if this pack add-in is properly installed. Click the Data tab. You see on the right hand side here there\u2019s a Data Analysis tab here. This same procedure has been used to install the Excel solver. When you did the portfolio optimization problem, you use solver Add-ins. But here we want to use a data analysis add-in. So next, after this ad and has been installed, you can just click this ad and you see the Data Analysis add-in has a lot of different functions that you can use. We will talk about this data analysis package, will use more of that later on in the course. But here, well, you want to do is select the sampling method. So if you click OK, then first there\u2019s a pop-up window here. The first input is input range. So the input range is where you want to put the population ranges. So this obviously is the income population. If you check this box here labels, you\u2019ll want to include this income. So Excel knows that the income has a label there. Now, right? So let\u2019s just choose the output options are uploaded in the same worksheet. You can check a new worksheet. So you will generate a different worksheet for the output. So for this problem, Let\u2019s just put the output here. You click Okay, see ten different income values are randomly selected. This is done by backstage algorithm provided by Excel to get these 10 different random samples from population. All right, so we will calculate the mean and median. So the standard deviation for this ten different sample also just to compare it with the population parameters. So this is the average. And the median equals the median. And the standard deviation is equal to STDEV.S. See you see the number you get. Also by comparing this simple statistic with population parameters, they\u2019re all different. But you see that when you compute from two different samples, they\u2019re estimated sample statistic. Each time you will get a different sample statistic. When you try to estimate the population parameters. Obviously it will be off. But later on when we talk about sampling error and the confidence interval, you will see how confident you will be by using this statistic. Now let\u2019s revisit our example and look at the bottom portion of the worksheet named\u00a0Example 1.\u00a0 Please follow along with the steps outlined below to set up the @Risk model. Choose the uncertain variables. In this example, they are the demand (cell H18) and the fixed cost (cell H19). Choose the distribution for the uncertain variables.\u00a0 See the screenshot with highlights in Figures 7.1 and 7.2 to set the distribution. Input the formula for calculating the output\u00a0(in this case, Total cost). Which is the same as in the previous two scenarios (=H19+H20*H18). Choose the @Risk output cell, which is H21. Select H21 cell and then follow the screenshot in Figure 7.3 to add output cell. Set the number of iterations for your simulation. That is how many times you want to choose random samples to calculate the Total Cost. Obviously, the larger number of iterations, the better the results are close to the actual output. Usually,\u00a0we set this number from 1000 to 5000. In this example, let\u2019s set the number of iterations to 5000. After you click the \u201cSimulate\u201d button, you should see the output as shown in Figure 7.4. You can see that the distribution of the Total Cost with the two uncertain variables is close to a bell-curve\u00a0 distribution. Analyze the results. You may click the \u201cExplore->Browse Results\u201d to see the simulation distribution results for the Total Cost. By default, the results show the\u00a0Confidence Interval\u00a0of 90% with 5% on the left tail and 5% on the right tail. However, you can change the interval. For example, if you want to see what is the probability that the Total Cost is less than $900, you can type 900 at the top part of the left slider and you will see the probability of the Total cost less than $900. See the screenshot in Figure 7.5.\u00a0Note that since this is a random sampling process, the resulting probability from your analysis may be different\u00a0from mine. You can also get a detailed output report by clicking \u201cReports->Output Reports\u201d and then choose cell H21 as the \u201cSelected outputs\u201d. See the screenshot in Figure 7.6. After you choose \u201cGenerate Report\u201d you will be asked to save the PDF version of the report. In the report, you can see the distribution of the Total Cost on the top. You will also see the\u00a0Tornado chart\u00a0which shows the sensitivity analysis of the impact of the demand and the fixed cost on the Total Cost. We will discuss the Tornado chart later when we discuss the sensitivity analysis. You can further click the \u201cfx Function\u201d->\u201dSimulation Result\u201d\u00a0to get some statistics from the output. For example, you can use \u201cRiskMean\u201d to calculate the mean of the Total Cost output. You can also use \u201cRiskPercentile\u201d to find out the percentiles of the Total Cost. Note that when doing the above, you can leave the \u201cSim #\u201d option blank since \u201cSim #\u201d indicates the simulation numbers when you want to repeat the simulation more than once. In this example, we only do simulation once and therefore, we leave the option blank Sensitivity analysis. It is always a good idea to see which uncertain variables have positive/negative impact on the outputs. We will rely on the\u00a0Tornado chart\u00a0to accomplish this job. You can click \u201cExplore->Browse Results\u201d and then click the icon at the bottom that looks like a tornado  and choose \u201cTornado-Correlation Coefficients\u201d. See Figure 7.7 for reference. We see that both demand and fixed cost have positive correlation with the Total Cost. However, the demand has a much higher correlation (equal to 100%) with the Total Cost, which means the higher the demand the higher the Total Cost (does this makes sense?). The steps provided above complete the basics of the Monte Carlo Simulation. For a more detailed introduction, you can refer to the following video. The model used here to illustrate @Risk\u2019s\u00a0basic features is of a company that is\u00a0planning to develop an e-commerce service. There is no marginal cost\u00a0of providing the service,\u00a0but a server facility must be\u00a0constructed which will require\u00a0an upfront investment for\u00a0each unit of annual capacity.\u00a0The unit cost of capacity is assumed to be\u00a080 cents and the revenue\u00a0per transaction is assumed to be $1.\u00a0The new service is a fat,\u00a0expected to be popular for only one year.\u00a0The transaction demand for\u00a0the year of business is uncertain,\u00a0but the company\u2019s best guesses\u00a0a demand of 2 million transactions. Therefore, the company must decide\u00a0how much capacity to\u00a0build for this single year of business.\u00a0If it builds more capacity than demand,\u00a0the extra capacity will be wasted.\u00a0If it builds less capacity than demand,\u00a0it will lose potential sales. To get started.\u00a0Here as a deterministic version of the model,\u00a0which assumes no uncertainty\u00a0in transaction demand.\u00a0Any demand could be\u00a0entered in the demand cell.\u00a0But the number used here is\u00a0the company\u2019s best guess, 2 million.\u00a0Also, any capacity could\u00a0be entered in the capacity sell.\u00a0The current value plans capacity for\u00a0the best guess of transaction demand.\u00a0And this is a good choice\u00a0for the deterministic model.\u00a0But there is no guarantee that it is best for\u00a0a model assuming uncertainty\u00a0and transaction demand,\u00a0as you will see shortly. The logic of the model is very simple.\u00a0Capacity cost is $0.80\u00a0times the capacity used.\u00a0Revenue is a dollar times the\u00a0smaller capacity and demand.\u00a0And profit is revenue minus cost.\u00a0It is important to realize that there is\u00a0an asymmetry in the model.\u00a0To see this, I will\u00a0enter a demand greater than\u00a0capacity and a demand less than capacity.\u00a0When demand is greater than capacity,\u00a0the company receives revenue only on\u00a0its capacity and the extra demand is lost.\u00a0So the profit is the same\u00a0for any demand greater than capacity.\u00a0However, when demand is less than capacity,\u00a0the company receives revenue only on\u00a0its demand and the extra capacity is unused.\u00a0In this case, profit\u00a0decreases as demand decreases.\u00a0This means that the most\u00a0profit the company can earn\u00a0with this capacity is $400 thousand.\u00a0But it could earn a lot\u00a0less if demand is small.\u00a0Now, starting with this deterministic model,\u00a0I\u2019m going to develop an at-risk model that\u00a0explicitly incorporates\u00a0uncertainty in transaction demand. As I go through this demonstration,\u00a0I will follow the typical steps for\u00a0developing any at-risk model.\u00a0Before you can use at risk,\u00a0you must loaded into memory.\u00a0This is easy. It can be\u00a0done with Excel already open,\u00a0or it can be done with Excel not yet open.\u00a0In the latter case, opening at risk\u00a0opens both Excel and at risk.\u00a0In either case, go\u00a0to the Windows Start button.\u00a0Find the Palisade Decision tools group and\u00a0the list of all programs and select at risk.\u00a0Of course, you can also have a shortcut to\u00a0at-risk on your desktop or your taskbar.\u00a0As you can see, it usually takes\u00a0a few seconds for at-risk to load.\u00a0You may get messy just like this one.\u00a0And eventually you will see\u00a0an at-risk welcome window.\u00a0Once you close this window,\u00a0you will know that at-risk is loaded because\u00a0you will see this at\u00a0risk tab for its breadth.\u00a0It, by the way,\u00a0you can see that I am using at\u00a0risk 6 for this video.\u00a0If you have used only earlier version,\u00a0you will see a few changes in\u00a0the basic modeling tools,\u00a0but nothing dramatic. To unload at risk from memory,\u00a0you have two choices.\u00a0If you close, excel\u00a0at risk will close as well.\u00a0Alternatively, you can click\u00a0the utilities drop-down of the\u00a0at-risk ribbon and select\u00a0unload at risk at it.\u00a0This unloads at risk but keeps Excel open.\u00a0I won\u2019t actually close it,\u00a0but here\u2019s how you would do it.\u00a0Now that at-risk is open,\u00a0I will walk you through the steps of\u00a0developing the at-risk e-commerce model.\u00a0Step one, decide which inputs are uncertain.\u00a0In this case, I assume that\u00a0only transaction demand is uncertain.\u00a0The other inputs, the unit cost\u00a0of capacity and the revenue\u00a0per transaction could also\u00a0be treated as uncertain.\u00a0But for this beginning application,\u00a0I will assume that these\u00a0two inputs are known to\u00a0be 80 cents and $1 respectively.\u00a0Step 2, choose a probability distribution\u00a0for uncertain transaction demand.\u00a0This step requires you to think carefully\u00a0about the uncertain transaction demand and\u00a0choose a probability\u00a0distribution that correctly\u00a0encodes your knowledge and\u00a0beliefs about the uncertainty.\u00a0For this example, a normal distribution with\u00a0mean 2 million and standard deviation\u00a0500000 is chosen,\u00a0but others could be chosen.\u00a0This is a subjective decision\u00a0and there\u2019s typically no right answer. To enter this probability distribution\u00a0in the transaction demand cell,\u00a0you could enter the formula directly,\u00a0just like you enter other Excel formulas.\u00a0But an easier way is to let at-risk help\u00a0you through it\u2019s defined\u00a0distributions button.\u00a0To do this, you first\u00a0choose the distribution you want,\u00a0in this case normal,\u00a0and then enter its parameters,\u00a0in this case,\u00a0the mean and standard deviation.\u00a0As you can see at risks,\u00a0risk normal function has\u00a0been entered in the green demands sell.\u00a0The risk static part\u00a0is entered automatically for you.\u00a0Indicates the value\u00a02 million that is shown in\u00a0this cell when the following setting\u00a0is toggled the stack.\u00a0Specifically look at the dice button\u00a0in the app risk ribbon.\u00a0This is a toggle.\u00a0It\u2019s either white or orange.\u00a0By default, it is toggled to white or static.\u00a0In this case at rest shows the mean of\u00a0the distribution and the uncertain cell.\u00a0So if you press the F9 key to\u00a0recalculate with new random numbers,\u00a0nothing happens if it\u2019s\u00a0toggled to orange or random,\u00a0which I will do now,\u00a0the uncertain cell really looks on\u00a0certain in the sense\u00a0that if you press the F9 key,\u00a0you can see many different scenarios.\u00a0You can decide which setting you prefer.\u00a0But one advantage to\u00a0the static setting is that\u00a0you see the results\u00a0from the deterministic model.\u00a0Fortunately, the setting has\u00a0no effect when you\u00a0eventually run the simulation.\u00a0Step 3, choose values\u00a0for any decision variables.\u00a0In this model, there is\u00a0only one decision variable\u00a0under the company\u2019s control.\u00a0Transaction capacity.\u00a0For now, a reasonable value,\u00a02 million will continue to be used,\u00a0but it will be very later on to find\u00a0a value with better profit potential.\u00a0Now is a good time to save your work.\u00a0Although this isn\u2019t really\u00a0a step in the at-risk process,\u00a0you should always\u00a0remember to save frequently.\u00a0Step 4, develop the logic\u00a0of the model with Excel formulas.\u00a0This is typically where you\u00a0spend a lot of time.\u00a0However, this has already been done\u00a0for you in rows 13 to 15.\u00a0In fact, the logic is exactly the\u00a0same as in the deterministic model.\u00a0However, because the revenue and profit sales\u00a0depend on the uncertain\u00a0transaction demand cell,\u00a0they change when demand changes,\u00a0as you can see by pressing the F9 key,\u00a0assuming that the dice button\u00a0is toggled to random.\u00a0This is the essence of simulation.\u00a0When uncertain inputs change, outputs change.\u00a0So you can see many different scenarios,\u00a0not just a single best guess scenario.\u00a0Step five, choose one\u00a0or more at risk output cells.\u00a0As you have already seen,\u00a0if you press the F9 key,\u00a0you get new outputs,\u00a0such as new profit values.\u00a0The trick is to keep track of these values as\u00a0the model recalculates over and over.\u00a0This is where you really\u00a0appreciate the power of that risk.\u00a0It allows you to designate\u00a0output cells of interest.\u00a0Then when the simulation runs\u00a0for hundreds or even thousands of\u00a0recalculations at risk keeps\u00a0track of the values in\u00a0the designated output cells.\u00a0And eventually let you see\u00a0these results in many different ways.\u00a0To designate any cell\u00a0as an at-risk output cell,\u00a0select the cell and\u00a0click the Add Output Button.\u00a0At risk will suggest a label for this output,\u00a0which it uses later in reports.\u00a0You can change this label if you\u2019d like.\u00a0For this model, I have designated\u00a0only one output cell, the profit cell.\u00a0But in general, you can\u00a0designate as many as you want.\u00a0Note that the formula has\u00a0changed to include risk output\u00a0and empty parentheses and a plus sign.\u00a0This is at risks way of indicating that\u00a0this cell is an at-risk output cell.\u00a0It has nothing to do with addition.\u00a0Step 6, change at-risk settings.\u00a0There are many ever settings you can\u00a0change from the simulation settings button.\u00a0However, you typically need\u00a0to change only one setting,\u00a0the number of iterations.\u00a0This is the number of recalculations or\u00a0repetitions that at-risk generates.\u00a0You should choose a reasonably\u00a0large value because you get\u00a0a more accurate estimate of\u00a0output distributions with more iterations.\u00a0The only downside to a large number of\u00a0iterations is increased computing time.\u00a0For practical purposes from 1000\u00a0to 5000 iterations is generally sufficient.\u00a0You can change the number of\u00a0iterations from this dialog,\u00a0or you can change it directly in\u00a0the iteration box right here.\u00a0By the way, I changed one other setting.\u00a0I chose a fixed random number seed of 123.\u00a0Although any other number would work,\u00a0you will typically want to\u00a0choose a random seed.\u00a0But I chose a fixed seed so that if\u00a0I needed to redo parts of this video,\u00a0I would get the same results each time.\u00a0If you choose a random seed,\u00a0you will get different results\u00a0each time you run the simulation.\u00a0Step seven, run the simulation.\u00a0This is the easy part.\u00a0Just click the Start Simulation button.\u00a0And although it is not visible here,\u00a0you will see a progress indicator\u00a0at the bottom of the screen.\u00a0Depending on the complexity of\u00a0your model and the number\u00a0of iterations you request.\u00a0The runtime can be\u00a0a few seconds or considerably longer.\u00a0Also, depending on which cell is\u00a0selected and your simulation settings,\u00a0you might see a distribution being\u00a0built as the simulation runs.\u00a0Specifically, depending on whether\u00a0this button is orange or white.\u00a0You might see a window\u00a0showing a histogram being built.\u00a0You might find this annoying.\u00a0So if you don\u2019t want to see\u00a0any simulation results as\u00a0the simulation is being run,\u00a0you can toggle this button to white.\u00a0The simulation results\u00a0will still be available,\u00a0but only after the simulation runs.\u00a0Again, this is a good time to save.\u00a0However, once you have\u00a0run an app or a simulation,\u00a0you are asked whether you want to save at\u00a0risk simulation results and grafts.\u00a0Either response is fine.\u00a0But you should understand the two options.\u00a0If you respond yes,\u00a0the simulation results will\u00a0be saved with the file,\u00a0and they will be available the\u00a0next time you open the file.\u00a0However, this can sometimes add\u00a0significantly to the size of the file.\u00a0On the other hand, if you respond know\u00a0the size of the file will remain unchanged.\u00a0But you will have to run the simulation\u00a0again the next time you open the file.\u00a0Step eight, analyze\u00a0the resulting output distributions.\u00a0This is the whole point of the simulation.\u00a0You want to see how an output such as profit,\u00a0varies as one or more uncertain inputs.\u00a0Buret, therefore, at risk\u00a0provides multiple ways\u00a0to view output results.\u00a0I will show the basic possibilities here,\u00a0and there are variations of\u00a0these you can explore on your own.\u00a0The easiest option is to select\u00a0an output and click\u00a0the Browse Results button.\u00a0This shows a histogram of\u00a0the selected output together with\u00a0many summary measures on the right.\u00a0By the way, you might have noticed\u00a0that many more summary measures are\u00a0shown in version 6 than in earlier versions.\u00a0There are also sliders you can move.\u00a0For example, if you move the left slider to\u00a00 or if you type 0 at the top,\u00a0you see the fraction of iterations\u00a0where profit is 0 or less.\u00a0So with this capacity,\u00a0the company stands about\u00a0a 21% chance of losing money.\u00a0The main takeaway from this histogram\u00a0is the skewness to the left.\u00a0This is in spite of\u00a0the symmetric normal distribution\u00a0of transaction demand.\u00a0The most profit the company\u00a0can make is 400000.\u00a0And this is a fairly likely\u00a0outcome that occurs whenever\u00a0the transaction demand is\u00a0greater than or equal to capacity.\u00a0It\u2019s this bar right here.\u00a0However, the company can also lose\u00a0a considerable amount of money\u00a0when transaction demand is low.\u00a0This chart is quite interactive\u00a0and at risk provides\u00a0a lot of options for changing\u00a0it with its buttons below the chart.\u00a0You can experiment with these.\u00a0For example, you can\u00a0click the third button from the left.\u00a0Select Copy Graph and\u00a0then paste it in the Excel.\u00a0The sliders no longer work,\u00a0but at least you have\u00a0a picture of the distribution.\u00a0But you can also browse\u00a0the distribution of an uncertain input,\u00a0such as transaction demand,\u00a0but this shouldn\u2019t provide any surprises.\u00a0You already specified\u00a0a normal distribution for this input.\u00a0So this is what you see.\u00a0A second option is to\u00a0click the summary button.\u00a0This shows summary measures of\u00a0all designated outputs on\u00a0one tab and inputs on another tab.\u00a0The summary measures include\u00a0a mini histogram,\u00a0the mean, the minimum,\u00a0the maximum, and fifth and 95th percentiles.\u00a0If you want more summary measures,\u00a0you can right-click and select\u00a0columns for table.\u00a0For example, I will\u00a0select standard deviation and median.\u00a0As with Browse Results,\u00a0there are a number of buttons at\u00a0the bottom that you can use.\u00a0Again, they are quite straightforward.\u00a0For example, you can\u00a0select the third button from the right.\u00a0Select copy and then\u00a0paste it into the worksheet.\u00a0Although there are better ways\u00a0to get the results in the worksheet.\u00a0The results you get from\u00a0the Browse Results button\u00a0or summary button are great,\u00a0but they disappear when you\u00a0close their windows unless\u00a0you copy them into Excel\u00a0as indicated earlier.\u00a0To get more permanent results,\u00a0you can click the Excel reports button.\u00a0However, before I generate a report,\u00a0you should understand where it goes.\u00a0By default at risk stores\u00a0reports in a new workbook,\u00a0not in the same workbook is your model.\u00a0If this is not the behavior you like,\u00a0you can change an at-risk\u00a0application setting.\u00a0Do so, click the utilities drop-down\u00a0and select Application Settings\u00a0and change place reports in\u00a0setting to be active workbook.\u00a0Right here. This setting\u00a0will stay in place for all future at\u00a0risk models until you change it again.\u00a0Back to Excel reports.\u00a0You can see that there are many options\u00a0and you can experiment with them.\u00a0However, the top option, quick reports,\u00a0is probably sufficient for\u00a0most of your analyses.\u00a0This generates a new worksheet.\u00a0And on the left there are several charts\u00a0including the histogram you saw earlier,\u00a0and accumulative probability distribution\u00a0plus a lot of summary measures to the right.\u00a0There are times when you might also want\u00a0output results to be stored in Excel cells.\u00a0And at-risk allows you to do\u00a0this with its statistical functions,\u00a0such as risk mean,\u00a0risk percentile, and others.\u00a0If you want to learn about these,\u00a0or at least see the possibilities,\u00a0you can click the Insert Function button\u00a0and select the simulation results group.\u00a0These are the statistical\u00a0functions you can use.\u00a0Each statistical function calculates\u00a0a summary measure of an output distribution.\u00a0For example, risk mean applied to profit\u00a0calculates the average of\u00a0all profits generated during the simulation.\u00a0Note that you can enter\u00a0these functions in a worksheet at any time,\u00a0but their values will not be\u00a0meaningful until you run the simulation.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0don\u2019t be surprised if Bs function show\u00a0unrealistic values or even generate errors,\u00a0the appropriate values will\u00a0appear once you run the simulation.\u00a0Several at-risk statistical functions\u00a0have already been entered in the model.\u00a0I painted them white to hide them,\u00a0but now I\u2019ll paint the black.\u00a0Here are some examples.\u00a0The risk mean function\u00a0returns the average of the prophets.\u00a0The risk standard deviation function\u00a0with two Ds returns,\u00a0the standard deviation of the profits.\u00a0The risk percentile, was\u00a0second argument equal to\u00a0a decimal number from 0 to one,\u00a0returns the requested\u00a0percentile of the profits.\u00a0For example, if the decimal is 0.05,\u00a0you get the fifth percentile.\u00a0The risk target function\u00a0was second argument equal to\u00a0any potential profit value returns\u00a0the fraction of profits\u00a0less than or equal to this type.\u00a0For example, if the last argument is 0,\u00a0you get the fraction of profits\u00a0that are 0 or negative.\u00a0If you want to greater than fraction,\u00a0you can subtract risk target from one.\u00a0For example, here is the fraction of\u00a0profits greater than 200000.\u00a0Also note that the fraction of\u00a0profits greater than 400 thousand is\u00a00 because such profits are\u00a0impossible with a capacity of 2 million.\u00a0To other buttons you might want to try are\u00a0the detailed statistics\u00a0and simulation buttons.\u00a0Detailed statistics, simulation data.\u00a0The details statistics provides\u00a0about all the summary statistics of\u00a0the outputs and the\u00a0uncertain inputs you could ever want.\u00a0These appear in a separate window,\u00a0but if you want them in your workbook,\u00a0you can click the middle button at\u00a0the bottom and copy\u00a0them or get a report in Excel.\u00a0The simulation data button provides data on\u00a0all uncertain inputs and\u00a0outputs for each of the iterations you ran.\u00a0So in this case, there are\u00a05 thousand rows in this table.\u00a0Again, you can move these into\u00a0your workbook quite easily if you want that.\u00a0Step nine, perform sensitivity analysis.\u00a0Once the simulation model has been developed,\u00a0it is always a good idea to use it as\u00a0a tool for sensitivity analysis at risk.\u00a0Let you run a number of sensitivity analyses,\u00a0some of which are rather advanced,\u00a0but I\u2019m going to describe only one type,\u00a0which is probably the most popular type.\u00a0This analysis ask the following question.\u00a0If a model has several uncertain inputs\u00a0and a specific output of interest,\u00a0which of these uncertain inputs\u00a0has the greatest effect on the output?\u00a0To answer this question at risk\u00a0provides a tornado chart where\u00a0the uncertain inputs with\u00a0the greatest effects have\u00a0the longest bars and\u00a0are shown at the top of the chart.\u00a0The e-commerce model developed so\u00a0far has only one uncertainty input.\u00a0So this sensitivity question\u00a0doesn\u2019t really apply.\u00a0To make it apply, I will change\u00a0the model slightly so that the unit cost of\u00a0capacity and the revenue per\u00a0transaction are also\u00a0treated as uncertain inputs.\u00a0Again, I will use the normal distribution\u00a0for these inputs,\u00a0but other distributions could be used.\u00a0I will also paint them green.\u00a0This isn\u2019t really necessary,\u00a0but it is my convention for indicating that\u00a0they contain at-risk\u00a0probability distributions.\u00a0Now, each of these three sources of\u00a0uncertainty has some effect on profit,\u00a0but which has the most effect.\u00a0To see, the simulation can\u00a0be run for 5 thousand iterations,\u00a0degenerate the histogram of\u00a0profit you have seen before.\u00a0This time, however, each iteration uses\u00a0different random values of\u00a0each of the three uncertain inputs.\u00a0You can now click the Tornado button.\u00a0You get several choices.\u00a0Although they all lead to similar results,\u00a0the correlation item is a good choice.\u00a0Each bar in this graph shows the correlation\u00a0between profit and\u00a0the corresponding uncertain input.\u00a0As you can see, the largest correlation\u00a0is with IT transaction demand.\u00a0The correlation is fairly strong at 0.77.\u00a0When demand is large,\u00a0profit tends to be large,\u00a0but when demand is small,\u00a0profit tends to be small.\u00a0The other two uncertain inputs have\u00a0much smaller correlations with profit.\u00a0Point 4, 2, and minus 0.28.\u00a0Of course, the negative correlation\u00a0between profit and cost of\u00a0capacity is expected when the cost of\u00a0capacity increases, profit decreases.\u00a0But the main takeaway from this chart is\u00a0the transaction demand has\u00a0the largest effect on profit.\u00a0Starting from this tornado chart,\u00a0you can also see scatterplots of\u00a0profit versus each of the uncertain inputs.\u00a0So this is an alternative way of seeing\u00a0how uncertain inputs are related to profit.\u00a0There\u2019s the scatter plot between\u00a0profit and transaction demand as an example.\u00a0By the way, you can also run\u00a0the sensitivity analyses directly\u00a0from the Tornado button in\u00a0the Results Group, this button right here.\u00a0Step ten, finding\u00a0good values of decision variables.\u00a0One important goal of this\u00a0E-commerce model is to find\u00a0a transaction capacity\u00a0with good profit potential.\u00a0Which value should the company use?\u00a0Of course, the company wants to choose\u00a0a value that has good profit statistics.\u00a0A large mean, a small standard deviation,\u00a0a large 95th percentile, and possibly others.\u00a0This is a difficult\u00a0choice and there might not be\u00a0a single value of capacity\u00a0that works best for all of these goals.\u00a0However, at risk has\u00a0a very useful function risk sim table that\u00a0lets you test different capacities\u00a0to see their effects on profit.\u00a0To use this function,\u00a0you first decide on\u00a0the capacities you want to test.\u00a0You can test as many as you\u2019d like.\u00a0Here, six possibilities will be tested.\u00a0Then in the blue decision sell,\u00a0you enter the risk sim table function,\u00a0not a value where the argument is the list of\u00a0values you want to test\u00a0enclosed in curly brackets.\u00a0Note that at-risk shows the first two beats\u00a01.2 million in the blue cell.\u00a0But when you run the simulation,\u00a0it will test all six.\u00a0Before running the simulation,\u00a0you\u2019d have to change one simulation set,\u00a0the number of simulations.\u00a0You should change this to the number\u00a0of capacities you want to test,\u00a0in this case six.\u00a0Then at-risk will run\u00a0this many separate simulations,\u00a0each with a number of iteration specified.\u00a05000. And it will\u00a0use the same random numbers in\u00a0each of the six simulations.\u00a0This latter point is important.\u00a0It means that one capacity won\u2019t win\u00a0the contest simply because\u00a0they\u2019ve got lucky random numbers.\u00a0Now, I will run the simulation.\u00a0All of the output reports discussed earlier\u00a0are available for each\u00a0of the six simulations.\u00a0This let you make comparisons.\u00a0For example, if you use Browse Results,\u00a0you can click the button\u00a0with the pound sign to\u00a0see any of the six profit distributions.\u00a0Or if you click the summary button,\u00a0you see summary measures for\u00a0all six of the simulations.\u00a0If you produce quick reports\u00a0from the Excel reports button,\u00a0you get a separate worksheet for each of\u00a0the simulations as shown next. Finally, if you\u2019d like to use\u00a0the statistical functions in\u00a0at risk, like risk mean,\u00a0you can append the last\u00a0argument to any of them,\u00a0the index one to six of the simulation.\u00a0I created the necessary formulas\u00a0to the right and painted\u00a0them white to hide them.\u00a0Now I\u2019ll paint them black.\u00a0Notice how I made these formulas copyable\u00a0to the right by making the profit cell\u00a0absolute and referring to\u00a0the simulation indexes in row\u00a016. Here\u2019s an example.\u00a0And I was able to copy that to the right.\u00a0Which of these capacity\u00a0should the company use?\u00a0The decision is still not an easy one,\u00a0but using capacity equal to mean\u00a0demand is certainly not a good choice.\u00a0It has a low mean profit,\u00a0a fairly large probability of losing money,\u00a0a relatively small probability of\u00a0making at least 200 thousand,\u00a0and a large negative fifth percentile.\u00a0In most respects, a larger capacity\u00a0like 2.2 million is even worse.\u00a0You could easily make an argument\u00a0for capacity of 1.4 million.\u00a0It has a high mean,\u00a0a low probability of losing money,\u00a0hi, probability of making at least 200000,\u00a0and a positive fifth percentile.\u00a0On the downside, it has\u00a0a relatively low 95th percentile.\u00a0If you are concerned only with mean profit,\u00a0you might instead favor\u00a0a capacity of 1.6 million.\u00a0In any case, the risk\u00a0sim table function allows you to make\u00a0a meaningful comparison\u00a0across these various capacities.\u00a0It is a very handy function\u00a0and at risks arsenal,\u00a0and you should get used to using\u00a0it whenever possible.

In this section, we will see how hedging can be used as an instrument to assist managers with financial risks. The two types of hedging that we will review are: Financial hedging involves using financial instruments or financial contracts to offset unexpected fluctuations in the exchange rates. The three types of financial heading instruments are: We will direct our attention to forwards and futures and options, as these instruments will be beneficial from a multinational perspective. Swaps will be covered in another course in the program. The fundamental difference between a forward future contract and an option is that forward future contracts are\u00a0obligations\u00a0you must satisfy the contract at maturity. For options, you do not have the obligation.\u00a0 Rather you have the\u00a0right\u00a0to exercise if it is favorable to you, or not exercise if you can get a better treatment in the market.\u00a0 Click on the plus icons (+) in the image below for an example. As mentioned previously, the goal of a corporation is to\u00a0maximize value\u00a0while\u00a0minimizing risk. A company must take into consideration the benefits of interest expense tax deductions as well as the costs of bankruptcy to determine a mixture of debt and equity that minimizes the firm\u2019s cost of capital. When companies mix and match various sources of funding, there becomes a possibility of reaching a combination which is optimal. The Value Max (Vmax) corresponds to the WACC Min.\u00a0WACC is a function of how much debt you have.\u00a0\u00a0But what proportion of funding should come from debt and how much should come from equity?\u00a0 That will lead to variations in the cost of capital. As shown in the image below, as your cost of equity goes up, your cost of debt goes up, and your WACC goes up. Initially, your WACC goes down when you increase debt, because you\u2019re getting taxation benefits of interest tax deductibility on debt. But as you continue to increase debt, it goes back up. So that brings you closer towards bankruptcy. That makes it riskier. We also see, as you increase debt, your cost of equity starts going up. Because your beta, the variability of your stock return to that of the market return, goes up as well. So your asset beta goes up. Hence, your cost of equity goes up, as we increase debt. So, you see that with increasing debt, your Ke goes up\u00a0, your WACC goes up\u00a0, and your Kd goes up\u00a0. Optimal Level The optimal for the WACC is the point where your WACC is at the minimum level. In the image above, it\u2019s shown at the point of\u00a0WACC Min. Correspondingly, the point where your WACC is at the minimum, is the point at which your Value is maximized (Max Val).\u00a0 So a company should mix and match, to find an optimality. Kd and Ke can be choice variables to find optimality. These choice variables include: So given these two factors, multinationals are unique because they have an opportunity to find geography and find financially engineered instruments, as to where to list and what to list. Unique Characteristics Faced by MNCs According to the textbook, the four unique characteristic variables Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) must handle when going abroad are: Select each header below for more information: Multinationals have a larger investor base in addition to the ability to list in a more liquid market where source of funding is cheaper.\u00a0 When they go abroad, they have a broader investor base that they have access to. Their sourcing of funding can be done at a cheaper rate, because there are more investors supplying the funds. Also, there is more liquid market. Not only is the investor base larger, but the trading activity, the liquidity might be better. Hence, going abroad might provide two simultaneous benefits of\u00a0larger investor base\u00a0and\u00a0listing in a more liquid market, resulting in lower cost of capital. Multinationals can create value through international diversification. The revenue sources of multinational corporations are broad and diverse \u2014 they can get their revenue from China, from India, from Bangladesh, from Switzerland, from Pakistan, from Russia. Due to the fact that the cash flows or revenues are coming from many different markets, that means they are diversified. The fluctuations in one country\u2019s revenues will be offset by the fluctuations in the other. So the dampening effect would be that the riskiness or the volatility of the cash flow will be lower. That would mean that for a multinational corporation with a diversified source of revenue, multinational corporations will have less risky source of revenue/cash flows. Hence, they may have a little better treatment at the hands of investors trying to invest their money in that company, because the company is less risky. However, MNCs do have additional risks. In particular, the foreign exchange risk. That will increase your cost of capital. So this might potentially decrease your WACC. Depending upon where you are listing abroad, the portfolio diversification theory does work in favor of MNCs. Because if greater number of companies are listing abroad, greater number of international investors have access to different company stocks and debts. So those expectations of more diversified portfolio from global investor perspective will have a bearing on whether a multinational is received positively or negatively, depending upon what the global investors have in terms of their expected risk, expected return, and their access to market instruments. So given the demand side of your portfolio, international portfolio investor expectations would also play a role. And in this sense, the WACC can go up or down depending upon various factors. At the completion of the course, you should be able to accomplish the following: In this lesson, you will explore the foundations of globalization and its impact on multinational enterprises (MNEs), focusing on how they create value, manage finances, and navigate their path toward global expansion. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how globalization shapes the operations of multinational enterprises, equipping you with foundational knowledge to analyze their financial and strategic decisions. In this lesson, you will delve into the fundamentals of foreign exchange markets, understanding their structure, key participants, and the types of transactions that occur. You will also explore how foreign currency quotes are represented and interpreted in practice. By the end of this lesson, you will have a thorough understanding of the mechanics of foreign exchange markets, the roles of participants, and the practical application of currency quotes, preparing you for deeper insights into global financial operations. In this lesson, you will explore the foundational theories of Parity Conditions, focusing on purchasing power parity (PPP) and interest rate parity, along with their real-world implications in currency markets. By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of how parity conditions affect exchange rates, price levels, and the behavior of international financial markets. In this lesson, you will learn about the various strategies and financial instruments used to hedge currency risk, focusing on how corporations manage their exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. By the end of this lesson, you should have a clear understanding of how companies use financial instruments like forwards, futures, and options to manage currency risk and protect against exchange rate volatility. In this lesson, you will explore the different types of currency exposure faced by businesses, including transaction, operating, and translation exposures, and understand how these exposures impact financial decision-making. By the end of this lesson, you should have a comprehensive understanding of transaction, operating, and translation exposures, and how businesses manage these risks to protect their financial interests in the global market. In this lesson, you will explore key concepts in cross-border investing, including global financial strategy, risk management, and how international capital markets influence investment decisions. By the end of this lesson, you will have a deeper understanding of how businesses and investors navigate the complexities of cross-border investments, manage risks, and apply financial models to global markets. In this lesson, you will examine the financing strategies used by businesses in international markets, focusing on optimal financial structures, managing foreign subsidiaries, and options for foreign equity listings. By the end of this lesson, students will have a comprehensive understanding of risk management practices in financial institutions, including the techniques used to manage credit and interest-rate risks, preparing them for advanced study in financial risk analysis and strategy. Multinational Managerial Finance offers prospective students a valuable opportunity to develop expertise in the financial management of global businesses. This course covers key concepts such as currency risk management, international capital budgeting, and the financing of multinational corporations, all of which are crucial for success in today\u2019s interconnected economy. By understanding how financial markets operate across borders and how multinational firms manage their capital structures and investments, students will be well-prepared for careers in international banking, corporate finance, and consulting. Graduates of this course will have the analytical skills to make strategic financial decisions that drive growth and stability in global business environments. A real-world example of how the concepts learned in Multinational Managerial Finance can be applied is seen in the strategic decisions of multinational corporations like Coca-Cola. When Coca-Cola expanded into emerging markets, it had to navigate currency fluctuations, adjust its financial structure for subsidiaries, and optimize its capital investments in different countries. By applying the principles of multinational finance, Coca-Cola managed transaction and operating exposure, used hedging strategies to mitigate currency risks, and made decisions on financing foreign operations using a mix of debt and equity. This real-world application of concepts such as international capital budgeting, risk management, and financing strategies highlights the direct impact that the knowledge gained in FIN 805 can have on making effective financial decisions in global markets. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Overview Unlocking Your Potential Lesson 7: Financing in International Markets Late PolicyHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsDevelop an analytical framework (by integrating international market structures, government exchange rate policy regimes, corporate stakeholder preferences, and value maximization goals) for planning, implementing, and evaluating multinational financial strategies.

While the primary focus is on addressing cognitive diversity and its impact on problem-solving, the concepts and techniques introduced are fully applicable to diverse team environments and industries. Through selected readings, case studies, and practical activities, the course guides students through the theory and application of group problem-solving strategies. Key topics include understanding cognitive gaps, managing differences in cognitive styles, and leveraging agents of change to enhance team dynamics. Students will also engage with the Paradox of Structure, a core concept that examines the balance between structure and flexibility in solving complex problems. The course will emphasize improving group efficiency, communication, and solution quality by analyzing real-world examples and applying learned strategies to case studies. Upon completing the course, students will be equipped with practical tools to optimize group performance and effectively address challenges in technical and managerial contexts. (3 credits) Theory and practical applications of group problem solving, including cognitive gap, coping behavior, agents of change, and managing cognitive diversity. This course builds on an understanding of the individual problem solver to address the dynamics of group problem solving, with a particular focus on the domains of science, engineering, and technical management. At the core of the course material is cognitive gap, i.e., differences in cognitive characteristics that may exist between problem solvers (both individuals and groups) and/or between problem solvers and the problems they solve. The Paradox of Structure remains a key concept in this course as well. Students will explore the impact of different cognitive profiles on problem-solving from multiple perspectives, including group efficiency, personal communication, and the quality of group outcomes. Strategies and tactics for improving the problem-solving performance of groups of all sizes will be learned and applied using real-world examples and case studies. Strategies and techniques for improving the problem-solving performance of groups of all sizes will be introduced and applied using real-world examples. The fundamental objective of this course is to help students become better and more insightful problem solvers\u00a0in collaboration\u00a0through an enhanced understanding of cognitive diversity within and between groups and the ways it can be leveraged to make problem solving more effective. Students who complete this course successfully will be able to: There are two exams proctored via\u00a0Honorlock\u00a0in this course: one midterm exam\u00a0(20% of course grade) and\u00a0one final exam\u00a0(20% of course grade). Note: A grade is given solely on the basis of the instructor\u2019s judgment as to the student\u2019s scholarly attainment (see\u00a0the Penn\u00a0State Graduate Degree Programs Bulletin). The following grading system applies to graduate students: Students are reminded that simply meeting the\u00a0minimal\u00a0requirements of any assignment (both in terms of content\u00a0and\u00a0presentation) will result in a letter grade of \u201cB\u201d or less for that assignment. Grades\u00a0will be based on the following scale: A = 95 \u2013 100, A- = 90 \u2013 94, B+ = 87 \u2013 89, B = 84 \u2013 86, B- = 80 \u2013 83, C+ = 77 \u2013 79, C = 70 \u2013 76, D = 60 \u2013 69, and F = Below 60. As noted above, there will be a discussion forum associated with each lesson. You are required to log on to\u00a0every\u00a0discussion forum and to post\u00a0at least\u00a0one direct answer or original observation related to the assigned theme and/or questions. You are also required to respond to the comments of your classmates during each discussion forum (please see the forum instructions, which specify the number of required postings). You are not required to follow threads from previous lessons unless specifically asked you to do so, but you are always welcome to post comments that relate to any previous discussion if it also relates to the current theme in some way. The instructor will monitor all discussion forums and will participate in them throughout the course and will evaluate your performance every week with feedback provided on how you are doing (as a group and/or on an individual basis). Your formal grade for discussion forum performance will be calculated based on the\u00a0number\u00a0of postings you make\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0quality\u00a0of your comments (e.g., degree of advanced thinking, quality of communication). There will be two written assignments during the course:\u00a0Reflection and Synthesis (R and S) #1-#2. These are due at the end of Lessons 3 and 6, respectively. The purpose of these assignments is to help you reflect upon, analyze, synthesize, and apply the material covered in this course. You are welcome to work together in the\u00a0early\u00a0stages of these assignments (e.g., discussing your ideas, pondering approaches, recommending references), but the final product must be\u00a0entirely\u00a0your own individual work. In completing each assignment, you are expected to submit neat, organized, and complete written documents that demonstrate higher order thinking and good communication skills (i.e., the quality of your writing\u00a0will\u00a0be assessed). Typed assignments (1.5 or double-spaced) are required. Each written assignment is worth a total of 100 points and 20% of your course grade. Of these 100 points, 80 points will be used to assess the content of your response (e.g., have you completed the required task, how well have you done so), while the remaining 20 points will be used to assess the quality of your communication (e.g., your writing \u2013 grammar, spelling, punctuation, clarity of expression, etc.). There will be two exams given in this course:\u00a0one midterm exam\u00a0(20% of course grade) and\u00a0one final exam\u00a0(20% of course grade). The purpose of these exams is to ensure your ready recall of fundamental concepts and key points covered in this course; they will not focus on minute detail (e.g., no dates). In terms of format, all exams will be primarily (if not completely) multiple choice, with the possibility of a few short answer questions. All\u00a0exams will be given as\u00a0closed-book,\u00a0closed-notes,\u00a0online\u00a0exams, offered within prescribed windows of opportunity during the appropriate week. All exams are to be completed\u00a0without\u00a0the collaboration or assistance of any other individuals, including other students. You will be \u201con your honor\u201d to follow these requirements. This course may require you to take exams using certain proctoring software that uses your computer\u2019s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record your activity during exams. The proctoring software may be listening to you, monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, recording and storing any and all activity (including visual and audio recordings) during the proctoring process. By enrolling in this course, you consent to the use of the proctoring software selected by your instructor, including but not limited to any audio and/or visual monitoring which may be recorded. *subject to change We will begin with cognitive gaps between individuals (alone and in groups), i.e., with Person-Person gaps. Once again, we will tend to focus on cognitive gap as applied to cognitive style, but the same understanding applies to level, motive, etc. \u2013 indeed, to any cognitive difference that impacts problem solving effectiveness. To help in the characterization of cognitive gap in terms of style, let\u2019s review some data related to discernible differences in cognitive style as measured by KAI. As you recall (see your text, p. 67, and your KAI feedback booklet, p. 5), 10 points is the\u00a0just-noticeable-difference\u00a0in KAI scores between two individuals (i.e., a difference noticeable to themselves and to others who know them well), or between one person and the mode style of a group. Research also shows that at a gap of about 20 points (i.e., roughly one standard deviation of the general population samples), considerable extra effort becomes necessary to ensure close agreement between those on either end of the gap\u00a0[3]. When two individuals are\u00a0more\u00a0than 20 KAI points apart, one or both of them will need increasing amounts of coping behavior, at least from time to time, for them to continue operating smoothly as a team. It is critical to note that it is the\u00a0size\u00a0of the gap that matters, not the absolute positions of the individuals (and/or groups) who are defining the gap along the relevant continuum of style or level. In Figure 1, for example, note that a style gap (say) between the lone individual on the right and the small group on the left can cause problems even when all five people are on the\u00a0same\u00a0side of the mid-point of the A-I continuum (i.e.,\u00a0all\u00a0may be adaptive or\u00a0all\u00a0may be innovative); the same principle would apply (in terms of level) if all the individuals were \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless\u201d experienced in some particular domain. It is the cognitive distance\u00a0between\u00a0them that is relevant in either case. Figure 1: Illustration of cognitive gap (person-person) Consider the relationship between the available\u00a0problem solvers\u00a0in a group and the\u00a0requirements\u00a0of a particular problem, using the curves shown in Figure 1 below. The solid curve represents the distribution of problem solvers along the A-I style continuum, and the dashed curve represents the style requirements of the current problem shared by the team (i.e., Problem A). Note that the relative locations of the\u00a0>AC2\u2019s and\u00a0>AC3\u2019s have also been marked on the diagram [see note]. Figure 1: Availability of problem solvers (solid line) and requirements of Problem A (dashed line) Early in this course, we reviewed briefly the 6-stage model of the change process developed by Kirton in his Management Initiative study. There are other schemas in the literature related to problem solving in groups, and it will be useful to explore one of them now \u2013 both on its own merits and in conjunction with A-I theory. In this case, the model relates to group development and was developed by Tuckman & Jensen\u00a0[3]; you may be familiar with it already. Turn to p. 290 of your text for a diagram of it and follow along. Tuckman & Jensen\u2019s schema is specifically intended as a model for group development in a\u00a0management\u00a0context. As such, it has two dimensions: These two dimensions form a \u201cmatrix\u201d of interaction between characteristic\u00a0human relations\u00a0and\u00a0task-oriented behaviors\u00a0at the various stages of group development, just as A-I theory refers to the management of diversity in terms of both the (technical) problem and the problem solvers. Tuckman & Jensen define and characterize these stages as follows: This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week. This lesson introduces the key assumptions and foundational concepts of Adaption-Innovation (A-I) theory. You will explore the principal elements of problem solving, including opportunity, motive, level, and style, while revisiting concepts from SYSEN 550 such as cognitive function schema, level-style distinction, and the Paradox of Structure. By completing this lesson, you\u2019ll establish a solid foundation for understanding collaborative problem solving through the lens of cognitive diversity, preparing for more advanced applications in later lessons. This lesson introduces the importance of diversity in human problem solving, focusing on the wide range of problems humans face and the equally diverse individuals who must solve them. You\u2019ll revisit Problems A & B as essential elements in collaborative problem solving and examine how cognitive gap provides a framework for understanding human diversity. By completing this lesson, you will understand the value of managing diversity and gain strategies for effectively addressing Problem A in the context of group problem solving.

You\u2019ll revisit Problems A & B as essential elements in collaborative problem solving and examine how cognitive gap provides a framework for understanding human diversity. By completing this lesson, you\u2019ll develop a deeper understanding of cognitive diversity and how to manage gaps effectively for successful group problem solving. This lesson begins with an introduction to the management of cognitive gap, focusing on the dynamics within small work groups. You\u2019ll explore how consensus subsets form and the roles of agents of change\u2014both insiders and outsiders\u2014in influencing group processes. Key topics include the cognitive climate of a team, the relationship between bridging and coping behaviors, and how A-I theory can inform models for group development. By completing this lesson, you\u2019ll gain practical insights into managing cognitive gaps, leveraging agents of change, and addressing resistance to foster successful group problem solving and collaboration. This lesson begins with an introduction to the concept of cognitive climate, examining its role in group problem solving. You\u2019ll explore how the composition of a group, including the cognitive diversity of its members, shapes the climate and influences outcomes. By completing this lesson, you\u2019ll gain a nuanced understanding of how cognitive climate, bridging, and coping behaviors contribute to effective problem solving and stress management in diverse teams. In this lesson, we will explore change management as a continuum, focusing on how it evolves over time. We\u2019ll begin by reviewing the key concepts covered so far and their application to managing change in collaborative problem solving. Normal change will be at the center of our discussion, highlighting its role in organizational dynamics and the progression of change over time. By looking at the concept of change as a continuum, you\u2019ll understand how shifts in style and approach affect both individuals and groups during periods of transition. By completing this lesson, you will develop the tools to approach change as a dynamic, continuous process and enhance your ability to adapt to problems that are constantly shifting, ensuring a more resilient approach to problem solving.

SYSEN 552 equips students with critical leadership and collaborative problem-solving skills tailored for the complexities of systems engineering. The course emphasizes managing cognitive diversity, facilitating effective team dynamics, and leading through change, preparing students to address real-world challenges in dynamic organizational settings. By mastering concepts like bridging cognitive gaps, managing change, and ethical leadership, students emerge with the tools to drive innovation, foster collaboration, and deliver successful project outcomes in systems engineering contexts. Graduates of SYSEN 552 are well-positioned for roles such as Systems Engineer, Project Manager, Team Lead, and Systems Architect. These positions require not only technical expertise but also the ability to lead diverse teams, manage multifaceted projects, and adapt to changing requirements. Employers in industries like aerospace, defense, healthcare, and technology value the skills gained in this course, which translate directly into effective leadership and problem-solving in complex systems. A transportation company faced a significant challenge in implementing a new autonomous vehicle system to optimize urban logistics. The project required collaboration among software developers, hardware engineers, urban planners, and legal teams. However, conflicting priorities among stakeholders\u2014such as maximizing efficiency for the engineers, ensuring public safety for the legal team, and aligning with city planning for the urban planners\u2014resulted in misaligned goals and frequent delays. Additionally, the project encountered resistance to change from employees concerned about job security and the public\u2019s skepticism of autonomous technology. To resolve these challenges, a systems engineer with strong problem-solving leadership skills was brought in to lead the effort. The engineer applied cognitive gap management to bridge the differing perspectives of the stakeholders, facilitating open communication and aligning the team\u2019s goals with the project\u2019s objectives. By implementing collaborative problem-solving techniques, the team successfully addressed resistance to change through transparent discussions and training sessions for affected employees. A process model was introduced to ensure that the technical, legal, and social considerations were integrated seamlessly into the project plan. As a result, the autonomous vehicle system was successfully implemented, improving delivery efficiency, reducing costs, and addressing safety concerns. This example illustrates the critical role of problem-solving leadership in navigating complex systems projects, managing change, and achieving alignment among diverse stakeholders. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: The Management of Change \u2013 Part II Unlocking Your Potential A.3 A Model for Group DevelopmentHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsAnalyze the cognitive resources of a problem solving group Break down complex problems based on cognitive variables Match cognitive resources appropriately with required tasks Design strategies for facilitating change through collaborative problem-solvingM.J.

After building our foundational toolbox in the early modules of the course, we use those tools to learn how to complete analysis to make better,\u00a0data-driven\u00a0decisions, and also learn how to\u00a0control\u00a0our operations. Let\u2019s now move on to summarize the \u201cincentives\u201d of cost allocation. What are Activities? Activities are events or tasks performed by each specialized group or activity center within the operation that causes the consumption of overhead resources (e.g., taking a customer\u2019s order). Each activity is a cost center. For example, imagine the costs generated just by taking a customer\u2019s order. This activity creates cost for the organization in a number of ways including employees, computers, internet access, phone lines, telephones, data usage, electricity, offices, desks, chairs, paper for creating purchase orders or special multi-copy purchase orders, printers, ink, envelopes, stamps, etc. (We\u2019re sure you can think of more!) So we identify the activities, then costs are first assigned to activities. Then, these activity center costs are then directly traced to products or allocated to products using a cost driver rate. Simple!\u00a0 Hmm\u2026. Does this sound familiar?\u00a0 It should. This is just like computing a predetermined overhead rate under absorption costing. First, we determine the type of transactions that generate the costs in each factory and/or support (administrative) department. We ask, \u201cWhat drives the cost in each department or activity center?\u201d Second, we then determine the type of cost driver. The driver will fit into one these five general activity level categories below.

A few basic reminders: *Subject to change Humans live in a connected world. Everything from social media to institutions (such as a government), processes (such as an economy), and infrastructures (such as a global airline network) form a complex network. But humans are not unique in being part of an interconnected system. We see complex networks in an entire ecosystem, interacting genes and communicating neurons. Network-based perspective, therefore, has been found to be useful in the study of complex systems in: There has also been a growing interest in sciences in the recent past to move away from the reductionist approach that focused on studying fundamental parts of a complex system. A system-level perspective considers a system as more than a sum of its parts and tries to understand emergent behavior that results from the interation of these parts. For this course, our interest will be in economic, political and social interactions shaped by social networks. Social networks play an important role in trade of goods and services, how we vote, how much education we obtain, whether we become criminals or succeed professionally. The myriad of ways in which a social network affects our lives raises many important questions: Networks are represented using graphs where the nodes or vertices of the graph denote\u00a0people or other entities, and the edges or links denote connections, relationships, or ties between the nodes. Depending on the field of your study, you may find nodes and edges described using other synonymous terms. Edges may have an intensity, i.e., they may be weighted. For example, if the network represents connections between colleagues at an institution, the weight of an edge may indicate the the number of hours they spend working together each week or the number of articles they have published together. Edges may also be unweighted. For instance, we may have a link between two people if they are friends with each other or no link otherwise. The edges may be undirected or directed with the direction of the edge indicating the direction of the relationship. Undirected edges may indicate mutual relationships such as two people being friends whereas directed edges indicate one-way relationship such as one webpage linked to the other but the other not linked to the one. shows an example of an undirected network represented as a graph and an adjacency matrix. The row and column numbers in the adjacency matrix represent the nodes of the network. A 0 at the intersection of a row and column indicates that the nodes represented by the particular row and column number are not linked; a 1 instead would indicate that they are linked. We typically give a network a name such as the letter\u00a0g, the row numbers are denoted by the letter\u00a0i, and the column numbers by the letter\u00a0j. We can, therefore, say the gij\u00a0= 1 if nodes\u00a0i\u00a0and\u00a0j\u00a0are linked. For example, g12\u00a0= 1 indicates that the nodes 1 and 2 are linked together. Since the graph is undirected, notice that it is also symmetric. For example, if g12\u00a0= 1 then g21\u00a0is also 1. An adjacency matrix is a convenient way to represent a network and lends itself easily to manipulation using linear algebra. But when we start working with very large networks (millions of nodes), a matrix can become rather large to load in the memory of a computer and work with. An alternative way to represent a network is using a list. For instance, the network of Figure 1 as a list could be represented as g = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {3,5}} or even g = {12, 13, 15, 23, 25, 34, 35}. The advantage that a list has over a network is that it is much more economical especially when a large matrix is sparse, i.e., there are only a few links in the network leaving most of the entries in the matrix as 0. Also, we sometimes are more interested just in the links rather than the whole matrix. Lists make it easier to keep track of the links. Figure 2 shows a graph and adjacency matrix for a directed network. The significant difference to notice that edges are directional and there is the lack of symmetry in the adjacency matrix. For instance, node 2 is connected to 5 but not the other way around. Also note that the convention is to indicate all outgoing edges from a node on its corresponding row. So the column can be thought of as indicating all the incoming edges into a node represented by that column. The list representation for this network would g = {12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35, 41, 45}. One thing to note here is that\u00a0the order of the nodes matter. For instance, we have a link 14 indicating a directed edge from 1 to 4 but we also have a link 41 indicating an edge in the other direction. We must now keep track of all directional edges. Networks can also be weighted. A weighted network puts weights on the edges between its nodes as shown in Figure 3. We can imagine this figure to represent a learning network where nodes are individuals who form opinions based on the information they receive from other nodes. For instance: Another interesting observation about the adjacency matrix in Figure 3 is that all of the wieghts are non-negative and each row adds up to 1, i.e., \u2211j\u00a0gij\u00a0= 1. Such networks are called row stochastic networks.\u00a0Not all wieghted networks need to be row stochastic. For instance, the network in Figure 4 shows emails being exchanged among individuals and the number of emails from one individual to the others don\u2019t have to add up to 1. All the representations we have seen so far are static but networks can evolve or change with time. We will examine ways for representing dynamic networks in a future lesson. Now that we know how networks are represented, in the next section we\u2019ll look at how to charcterize networks by measuring some of their properties. Basic topographical measures such as size, average distance, and diameter provide information on a network as an aggregate, giving analysts an ability to gauge the overall potential of the network in terms of capacity and performance and also providing a context within which to interpret other measures that may come further down the analysis pipeline. Table 1 provides a summary of these measures. Network size\u00a0is simply a count of the number of actors in a network. Knowing a network\u2019s size is important when interpreting measures sensitive to it, such as density or diameter. For instance, it is meaningless to compare densities of networks that are dissimilar in size. Size can also be used to understand if a network is growing or shrinking over time. A dark network that is consistently growing is likely recruiting successfully. Analysts should be careful, however, and understand how the boundaries of a network have been defined or else they may\u00a0not\u00a0be looking at the true size of the network. Average distance\u00a0places more emphasis on the ties between actors within a network. It is measured as the average length of all the shortest paths or geodesics between all actors in a network. It provides an analyst with a means to determine how fast information can spread throughout a given network. All things being equal, networks with lower average distance should be more efficient in diffusing information and resources than those with a higher average distance. This information can be used to formulate a deception campaign strategy that relies on spreading disinformation to undermine the operations of a dark network. However, care has to be taken with the timing of such campaigns since networks are dynamic and the average distance of a network is likely to change with time. Network diameter\u00a0measures a network\u2019s longest geodesic and indicates how dispersed a network is. Networks with large diameters may be more dispersed than those with small ones. Dispersed or decentralized networks are better suited to solving complex and challenging problems while maintaining their operational security when compared to more centralized or hierarchical networks. However, since a network diameter is closely related to its size, we should be careful when comparing diameters of networks of different sizes. The basic topographical measures highlight some tradeoffs that dark networks may face and provide evidence for the potential of these networks. These relationships, however, may not be as clear cut and, therefore, these measures should, at first blush, be used just as an evidence of potential. For instance, a network with small average distance could be vulnerable to misinformation campaigns but could equally prevent disinformation from spreading among its members.

A few basic reminders, harking back to your Online Orientation: *Subject to change The most common concept related to storing data is a \u201cdatabase\u201d. Merriam Webster dictionary defines a database as: \u201ca usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval (as by a computer)\u201d. So, according to this definition, any collection of related data constitutes a database \u2013 including file cabinets, text files, Excel files, Access databases, and so on. This is contrary to the common understanding of the concept in technical circles that associate the concept of a database to Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase. These systems are\u00a0relational database management systems\u00a0but people just call them databases. The emergence of database systems was a crucial development in providing accurate and timely information to managers. A\u00a0database\u00a0is a collection of data sets that are related to domain or subject and that are processed for extracting information using an application system. However, a database system is much more than data, or data in combination with database management software.\u00a0It is comprised of hardware, software, data, and people. It is important to note when someone buys the latest\u00a0Oracle product\u00a0seeking to develop a database for a specific purpose, Oracle does not deliver a solution for that problem (set of tables, indexes, etc.). Rather, they deliver a framework that facilitates efficient storage of the business-related data. This framework is known as a\u00a0database management system (DBMS)\u00a0and has the purpose of facilitating the creation of databases. A DBMS manipulates the database\u00a0and appropriate hardware and personnel.\u00a0 A DBMS is usually purchased from a software vendor and is an application program or the tool an end-user uses to view and manipulate data in the database. The image in Figure 1.1 shows such an example for an Oracle DBMS. In this case, starting a database means starting some processes in an Oracle instance that will facilitate the access of users to a database stored in data files in an Oracle readable format. Essentially, a DBMS facilitates access to files that may be otherwise accessed by other similar products. So, in theory, we could develop a DBMS that could use comma-separated variable files as the underlying storage. Why don\u2019t we? Well, there are many advantages to using DBMS applications, ranging from security to redundancy control, or from efficiency to concurrency. For a complete answer to this question, please read Section 1.6 in your textbook to find a complete list of advantages of databases over other methods of data storage. However, a closer look into using a DBMS application to manage and store information would reveal some drawbacks. One of the most important drawbacks is the \u201cDanger to Overkill\u201d, which relates to small and simple applications with small quantity and diverse data serviced by a small number of users. This is the case for all those applications that do not need a lot of aggregations to be interpreted, and for which the lifespan of information is short. For example, a shopping list application may not need a database because we rarely care about what we bought last month. Often these applications use simple files to store data and retrieve it with\u00a0SQL Lite\u00a0when installed on devices such as smartphones.\u00a0Generally speaking, the time, knowledge, and resource commitment can be high when using DMBSs.\u00a0For example, the installer for Oracle Client 12c is 925 megabytes in size, which is up from ~500 megabytes for Oracle 10.2.\u00a0This, together with proper setup procedures, makes it difficult to set up for small projects. Normalization refers to rigorous standards for good design, designed formally, and methods for testing a database design. A good design practice should avoid redundancy as much as possible. Many times, databases are hidden from the user by an application layer and for that reason, many people consider database design as a secondary task. Table 6.1\u00a0below shows an example of poor database design: Table 6.1:\u00a0Poor database design Let\u2019s Look at Some Of The Problems With Table 6.1: Repeating Groups: The course name and instructor are repeated for each class. If a student needs a third class, you need to go back and modify the table design to record it. While you could add CourseID3, CourseID4, CourseID5, etc., along with the associated description and instructor fields, no matter how far you take it there may one day be someone who wants one more class. Additionally, adding all those fields when most students would never use them is a waste of storage. Inconsistent Data:Let\u2019s say that after entering these rows, you discover that Bill Ocean\u2019s\u00a0course is titled \u201cAdvanced Visual Basic\u201d. To reflect this change, you would need to examine all the rows and change each individually. This introduces the potential for errors if one of the changes is omitted or done incorrectly. Delete Anomalies: If you no longer wished to track Billy Idol\u00a0Intro to DAO class, you would need to delete two students, two advisors, and one additional instructor to do it. If you remove the first two rows of the table, all the data is deleted with the reference to the course. Insert Anomalies: Perhaps the department head wishes to add a new class \u2013 let\u2019s call it\u00a0\u201cAdvanced DAO Programming\u201d\u00a0\u2013 but hasn\u2019t yet set up a schedule or even an instructor. What would you enter for the student, advisor, and instructor names? (CLICK TITLES TO LEARN MORE) SET TRANSACTION: Initiates the beginning of a transaction. This command is optional. A transaction will be started automatically when you start SQLplus, commit the previous transaction, or roll back the previous transaction. COMMIT: Saves any change you just made. This command ends the current transaction by saving database changes and starts a new transaction. COMMIT; Implicit COMMIT occurs when: ROLLBACK: Discards every change you made since the last\u00a0COMMIT. This command ends the current transaction and starts a new transaction. ROLLBACK; Implicit ROLLBACK occurs when: SAVEPOINT: Defines breakpoints for the transaction to allow partial rollbacks. It can divide a transaction into several segments. UPDATE products SET quantity = 55 WHERE product_no = 588;SAVEPOINT so_far_so_good;UPDATE products SET quantity = 60;ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT so_far_so_good;COMMIT; LOCK TABLE: Locks entire database tables in a specified lock mode. That enables sharing or denying access to tables while maintaining their integrity. It has multiple locking options such as: LOCK TABLE products IN SHARE MODE;LOCK TABLE products IN EXCLUSIVE MODE; This course focuses on foundational database design concepts, including relational modeling, relational algebra, SQL, and data normalization.

The overall goal of data analysis is to support better decision-making. Before we discuss in more detail, let us have an overview of basic data mining concepts. Data is a collection of facts or information, such as numbers, words, text, measurements, observations or descriptions of things. A dataset is a collection or group of related data. Each group and its members have\u00a0the same set of attributes (variables) as others in the same dataset. Some examples of datasets include: Data is everywhere. Across a broad range of applications, data is being collected at an unprecedented rate. In the past, decisions were made purely based on guesswork, expert opinions, or on painstakingly constructed models of reality. But nowadays, decisions can be solely based on the data itself. Big Data has the potentiality to revolutionize different aspects of modern society including scientific research, financial services, retail manufacturing, biological and physical sciences, healthcare, transportation, environmental modeling, energy saving, homeland security, and social network analysis. For instance, consider the field of biological sciences where there is a tradition of creating public repositories and depositing scientific data into these public repositories. The amounts of data that are being produced and deposited into these public repositories are exponential. Once the data are recorded in these repositories by the scientists, the next step is to curate and analyze these data. Thus, emerged the discipline\u00a0Bioinformatics, which is largely devoted to curating and analyzing the data in the public repositories. In this field the\u00a0Bioinformaticians, data scientists with knowledge in computation and biological sciences, play a major role. They are largely faced with a daunting task of dealing with a large volume of both structured and unstructured data. Click on each heading below to learn more The potentiality of Big Data is unimaginable. In the\u00a0education sector\u00a0it is quite evident that the collected data related to the academic performance of every student can be used as a guide for delivering future instruction. It is well-known in the\u00a0healthcare sector\u00a0that Information Technology (IT) can reduce the cost of the healthcare while improving its quality by making care more preventive and personalized. With the advent of Big Data and IT, savings in the healthcare sector is estimated to be close to 300 billion dollars in US alone. Big Data can help also in other sectors, such as: While the potential benefits are real and significant, and some initial success has been achieved, there remain many technical challenges that need to be addressed to completely realize its potential. But there are also other dimensions to it. In addition to\u00a0Volume are\u00a0the dimensions of\u00a0Variety,\u00a0Velocity,\u00a0Variability\u00a0and\u00a0complexity. Volume: This dimension refers to the amount of data; Example\u2013 it may be the email you send, Twitter, Facebook, or other social media, or it can just be all the videos, pictures, SMS messages, call records, and data from varied devices and sensors. We have scaled up the data\u2013measuring metrics to terabytes, zettabytes and Yottabytes \u2013 they are all humongous figures. Look at Facebook alone; it\u2019s like ~10 billion messages on a day, consolidated across all users. We have ~5 billion likes a day and around ~400 million photographs are uploaded each day. Velocity: This refers to the data generation speed, or the rate at which data is being generated. In today\u2019s world, where we mentioned that the volume of data has undergone a tremendous surge, this aspect is not lagging. We have loads of data because we are able to generate it so fast. Look at social media; things are circulated in seconds and they become viral, and the insight from social media is analyzed in milliseconds by stock traders, and that can trigger lots of activity in terms of buying or selling. Variety: This dimension tackles the fact that the data can be unstructured. In the traditional database world, and even before that, we were used to having a very structured form of data that fitted neatly into tables. Today, more than 80% of data is unstructured \u2013 quotable examples are photos, video clips, social media updates, data from variety of sensors, voice recordings, and chat conversations. Veracity: It\u2019s all about validity and correctness of data. How accurate and usable is the data? Not everything out of millions and zillions of data records is corrected, accurate, and referable. That\u2019s what actual veracity is: how trustworthy the data is and what the quality of the data is. Examples of data with veracity include Facebook and Twitter posts with nonstandard acronyms or typos. Big data has brought the ability to run analytics on this kind of data to the table. Value: This is what the name suggests: the value that the data actually holds. It is unarguably the most important V or dimension of big data. The only motivation for going towards big data for processing super large data sets is to derive some valuable insight from it. In the end, it\u2019s all about cost and benefits. The rectangular region formed from the intersections of the regions of the circles corresponding to the 3V\u2019s of Big Data namely \u201cVolume\u201d, \u201cVelocity\u201d and \u201cVariety\u201d is coined as\u00a0Fast Data. SEM is a form of structural models where there is a very complex relationship between the latent constructs. The latent constructs may influence one another in different ways. The concept related to latent variables and manifest variables were introduced in Lesson 10 when we discussed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). In this lesson we will look into a model for\u00a0repeat purchase intention. In this model, the cost of a product is associated with both perception of value and intent to repurchase, while perception of quality relates to both perceived value and satisfaction, which is then associated with repurchase. To validate this model, we would collect data from the customer using a\u00a0customer satisfaction ratings survey instrument. In this lesson, we will explore the dataset that contains the responses of 200 customers who took the customer satisfaction rating survey. All the customers who took this survey responded to the 15 satisfaction Items (manifest variables) in the survey, where there were three items for each of the five Factors of\u00a0Quality,\u00a0Cost\u00a0(fair pricing),\u00a0Value,\u00a0Customer Satisfaction\u00a0(CSat), and\u00a0Repeat purchase intention. Table below lists the 15-item survey instrument for purchase satisfaction, perceived value, and repurchase intent. For each question in the survey, the customer responds on Likert scale score of 1-7, where 1 indicates\u00a0least\u00a0and 7 indicates\u00a0most. Once we have collected the consumer data from the survey, our goal would be to initially ascertain whether our proposed model of influence \u2014 for example, that perception of cost is associated with both perception of value and intent to repurchase. Finally, if the model fits the data well, then we would try to address the following questions: MB analysis is a data mining technique that has the purpose of finding the optimal combination of products or services and allows marketers to exploit this knowledge to provide recommendations, optimize product placement, or develop marketing programs that take advantage of cross-selling. In short, the idea is to identify which items go well together, and profit from it. You can think of the results of the analysis as an\u00a0if\u2026then\u00a0statement. If a customer buys an airplane ticket, then there is a 46 percent probability that they will buy a hotel room, and if they go on to buy a hotel room, then there is a 33 percent probability that they will rent a car. There are some terminologies associated with the MB type of analysis.\u00a0 Select each term below to become familiar with the terminology.

These steps and related methods are discussed in detail in future lessons. Figure 1.2 only provides a brief description of each step to give you a general idea about what a simulation project involves: The approaches presented in this lesson rely on the assumption that the sample data are independent and identically distributed (IID) which requires the following two characteristics: Data collected from a real system may not be IID.\u00a0 For example, consecutive waiting times in a queue for customers at a restaurant are\u00a0NOT INDEPENDENT\u00a0since a long waiting time for customer\u00a0ii\u00a0means it is highly likely that customer\u00a0i+1i+1\u00a0also has a long waiting time in queue. Such observations are said to be\u00a0correlated.\u00a0 As another example, suppose that\u00a0X1,X2,\u00a0\u2026X1,X2,\u00a0\u2026\u00a0represent hourly temperatures in a certain city starting at noon on a particular day.\u00a0We would not expect these data to be independent, since hourly temperatures close together in time should be positively correlated. Here, we focus on the \u201cindependence\u201d component of the IID requirement and present a simple approach to assess independence of the collected data.\u00a0In the \u201cRecommended Supplementary Material\u201d for this lesson, you can find a video module that describes a situation related to a non-stationary arrival process with a time-varying arrival rate, where the samples collected from different time intervals may not be identically distributed. A simple graphical method for assessing correlation in the data is by using the\u00a0scatter diagram\u00a0of the observations\u00a0X1,X2,\u00a0\u2026,XnX1,X2,\u00a0\u2026,Xn\u00a0from a stochastic process. This is essentially a plot of the pairs\u00a0(Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1\u00a0for\u00a0i=1,2,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0n\u22121i=1,2,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a0n-1. If\u00a0Xi\u2019sXi\u2019s\u00a0are independent, one would expect the points\u00a0(Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1\u00a0to be scattered randomly throughout the\u00a0(Xi,Xi+1)Xi,Xi+1\u00a0plane. Figure 4.1 provides sample scatter diagrams for independent and correlated data. The assembly process is a serial production line consisting of four stages (shown in Figure 7.2)\u00a0with fixed-capacity buffers between the stations (total of 20 buffer slots). The line operates 24/7 and the raw material inventory is managed so that it is guaranteed that there is always raw material available to be processed. The line is also perfectly balanced meaning that the processing time distribution is the same for all four stages and follows an exponential distribution with a mean 10 minutes. Therefore, this production line represents the situation we analyzed in section 4 of Lesson 5.\u00a0Please go back to that section for a review before you continue.

By completing this lesson, you\u2019ll be able to design and evaluate simulation meta models, quantify input uncertainty, and implement custom performance measures, equipping you with advanced tools to tackle complex simulation challenges effectively. This lesson explores the need for hybrid simulation models to analyze complex integrated systems that cannot be addressed using a single modeling technique. You will learn to combine simulation approaches for more robust analysis and problem-solving. By completing this lesson, you will be equipped to design and implement hybrid simulation models, combining techniques like discrete-event and Monte Carlo simulation, to tackle complex challenges in integrated systems. SYSEN 532 equips students with in-demand skills in simulation modeling and analysis, preparing them for roles that require advanced problem-solving capabilities in complex systems. By mastering techniques such as discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo methods, and hybrid simulation frameworks, students can tackle challenges in industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, aerospace, and defense. These industries rely on professionals who can design, optimize, and validate integrated systems using data-driven approaches. This course enhances career prospects for positions such as systems engineer, simulation analyst, operations research analyst, or industrial engineer. Employers seek individuals with expertise in simulation tools like Simio and a strong foundation in statistical and optimization techniques. The practical and theoretical knowledge gained from SYSEN 532 is directly applicable to job roles that involve analyzing system performance, optimizing operations, and supporting strategic decision-making. A manufacturing company sought to improve its assembly line operations to increase efficiency and reduce production costs. The current system faced challenges such as bottlenecks at certain workstations, inconsistent product flow, and resource allocation issues. Traditional analytical methods were insufficient to capture the dynamic interactions and variability within the system, leading to suboptimal solutions. To address this, the company enlisted a systems engineer trained in discrete-time simulation to analyze the assembly line. Using discrete-event simulation techniques, the engineer modeled the entire production process, incorporating key variables such as machine processing times, resource availability, and product demand fluctuations. The simulation revealed critical bottlenecks and identified scenarios where resource allocation could be improved. The engineer then used simulation-optimization techniques to test various configurations, such as reallocating workers, adjusting machine schedules, and redesigning workflows. A hybrid simulation model combining discrete-event and Monte Carlo methods was employed to assess the impact of uncertainty in product demand and machine reliability. This approach allowed the team to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of proposed changes under different conditions. As a result, the company implemented an optimized assembly line configuration that reduced bottlenecks, improved throughput, and minimized operational costs. This example highlights the real-world value of discrete-time simulation in systems engineering for solving complex, integrated system challenges. \u00a9 2025 Penn State Great Valley Lesson 7: Hybrid Simulation Unlocking Your Potential Optional Texts and Other ResourcesHome EngineeringExpand\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nData Analytics (Base Program)\nData Analytics (Big Data Systems)\nData Analytics (Business Analytics)\nData Analytics (Marketing Analytics)\nEngineering Management\nInformation Science\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Engineering Artificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems Engineering ManagementExpand\n\n\nMaster of Professional Accounting\nBusiness Administration\nFinance\nFinancial Data Analytics Master of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data Analytics Graduate Certificates Prep Courses Great ValleyArtificial Intelligence Data Analytics (Base Program) Data Analytics (Big Data Systems) Data Analytics (Business Analytics) Data Analytics (Marketing Analytics) Engineering Management Information Science Software Engineering Systems EngineeringMaster of Professional Accounting Business Administration Finance Financial Data AnalyticsMathematics Knowledge of probability and statistics (e.g, undergraduate statistics equivalent to STAT 200) Use of Excel Coding (in any programming language or generic tool/package such as MATLAB)Determine an appropriate type of simulation model to properly account for stochasticity and uncertainty in a system.

In lesson 2, we tried some basic graphs in R. We will learn and exercise much more techniques employed in R, including imported libraries supports. Let\u2019s start with the simplest plot function,\u00a0plot(x,y) can draw a scatter plot, where x-axis represents x value in order and y-axis represents y values. We continue to use the dataset from a telecommunication organization. After loading the Customers.xlsx, for example, plot(Customers$Age, Customers$Est_Income) will create the following scatterplot (Fig. 3.1.1). The Regression Model is a statistical methodology that studies the relationships between different variables so that we can predict one variable from other variables. In\u00a0linear regression, the output variable (also termed as dependent variable, outcome, or response) is predicted by a linearly weighted combination of input variables (also termed as independent variables, features, or predictors). Here is an example of a simple linear model: y\u02c6=\u03b21x+\u03b20y^=\u03b21x+\u03b20 \u0177 is the estimated output, which is calculated from a linear function of a single predictor variable or feature\u00a0x.\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0are the parameters of the model and are usually termed as regression coefficients. The number of\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0changes with the number of features of a model. We always have an extra coefficient termed as intercept\u00a0\u03b20, which is the value when all features are valued at zero. The other\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0coefficients can be interpreted as the expected change in \u0177 due to per unit increase of a corresponding feature. The linear regression model tries to find the best\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0to minimize sum of square error. Tree-based Methods As one of supervised learning algorithms, tree-based methods are mostly used in classification problems. By relying on greedy strategies, tree-based methods essentially consist of a series of rules that can be generated using a tree structure (Fig. 7.1.1 and Fig. 7.1.2). Tree-based methods are easily used for predictions applicable for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In general, if the output variable is categorical, we use a decision tree to handle classification problems (Fig. 7.1.1). If the output variable is continuous or numerical, we then use it to tackle regression problems (Fig. 7.1.2). This course will provide you with a thorough introduction to: During this course you will expand your knowledge of the lesson topics each week.

If you are experiencing serious difficulties in completing an assignment (for any reason), please let me know as soon as possible \u2013\u00a0I want to help you succeed. A few basic reminders, harking back to your DAAN Online Orientation: *Subject to change With the flood of data available to businesses, companies are turning to analytics solutions to extract meaning from the huge volumes of data to help improve decision making. Companies are attempting to optimize their efforts to analyze historical data, forecast what might happen in the future. The promise of doing it right and becoming a data driven organization is great. Companies can enjoy huge returns on their investments if they can leverage the big data in to optimizing their supply chain, lowering their operating costs, increase revenues and/or improve their customer service. Analytic options can be categorized at a higher level into three distinct types namely\u00a0descriptive,\u00a0predictive\u00a0and\u00a0prescriptive. No one type of analytic is better than the another, and in fact, they co-exist with, and complement each other. In order for the business to have a holistic view of the market and compete efficiently they should have a very robust analytic environment which includes [3]: Descriptive analysis or statistics does exactly what the name implies they \u201cDescribe\u201d, or summarize the raw data and make it something that is interpretable by humans. They are analytics that describe the past. The past refers to any point of time that an event has occurred. Descriptive analytics are useful because they allow us to learn from past behaviors, and understand how they might influence the future outcomes. The vast majority of the statistics that we use fall into this category. Usually, the underlying data is a count, or aggregate of a filtered column of data to which the basic math is applied. For all practical purposes, there are an infinite number of these statistics. Descriptive statistics are useful to show things like, total stock in inventory, average dollars spent per customer and Year over year change in sales etc. Use Descriptive Analytics when you need to understand at an aggregate level what is going on in your company, and when you want to summarize and describe different aspects of your business. Predictive analytics has its roots in the ability to \u201cPredict\u201d what might happen. These analytics are about understanding the future. Predictive analytics provides companies with actionable insights based on data. Predictive analytics provide estimates about the likelihood of a future outcome. It is important to remember that no statistical algorithm can \u201cpredict\u201d the future with 100% certainty. Companies use these statistics to forecast what might happen in the future. This is because the foundation of predictive analytics is based on probabilities. These statistics try to take the data that you have, and fill in the missing data with best guesses. They combine historical data found in ERP, CRM, HR and POS systems to identify patterns in the data and apply statistical models and algorithms to capture relationships between various data sets. Companies use Predictive statistics and analytics anytime they want to look into the future. Predictive analytics can be used throughout the organization, from forecasting customer behavior and purchasing patterns to identifying trends in sales activities. One common application most people are familiar with is the use of predictive analytics to produce a credit score. These scores are used by financial services to determine the probability of customers making future credit payments on time. Typical business uses include, understanding how sales might close at the end of the year, predicting what items customers will purchase together, or forecasting inventory levels based upon a myriad of variables. Use Predictive Analytics any time you need to know something about the future, or fill in the information that you do not have. Predictive analytics is widely used today in many industries such as healthcare, life sciences, insurance, and finance. Predictive analytics employ a combination of scientific methods and techniques such as the following: Predictive models use known results or the training datasets to develop a model that can be used to predict values for a different or the test data. Modeling provides results in the form of predictions that represent a probability of the target variable (for example, revenue) based on estimated significance from a set of input variables. This is different from descriptive models that help you understand what happened, or diagnostic models that help you understand key relationships and determine why something happened. There are two types of predictive models: Classification\u00a0models\u00a0i.e.\u00a0to predict the class membership. For instance, you try to classify whether someone is likely to leave, whether he/she will respond to a solicitation, whether he\u2019s/she\u2019s a good or bad credit risk, etc. Usually, the model results are in the form of 0 or 1, with 1 being the event that is being targeted. Regression\u00a0models\u00a0on the other hand predict a number \u2013 for example, how much revenue a customer will generate over the next year or the number of months before a component will fail on a machine. In this\u00a0lesson, we will focus our readings on Regression models. Classification models will be reviewed in the later lessons. Regression\u00a0is one of the most popular method in statistics. Regression analysis estimates relationships among the variables. Intended for continuous data that can be assumed to follow a normal distribution, it finds key patterns in large data sets and is often used to determine how much specific factors, such as the price, influence the movement of an asset. With regression analysis, we want to predict a number, called the response variable. With linear regression, one independent variable is used to explain and/or predict the outcome of the response variable. Multiple regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome (response variable). With logistic regression, unknown variables of a discrete variable are predicted based on known value of other variables. The response variable is categorical, meaning it can assume only a limited number of values. With binary logistic regression, a response variable has only two values such as 0 or 1. In multiple logistic regression, a response variable can have several levels, such as low, medium and high. In order to review the different types of regression analysis read through the document \u201c7 types of Regression techniques you should know!\u201d from the link\u00a0https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/ Various statistical, data-mining, and machine-learning algorithms are available for use in your predictive analysis model. You\u2019re in a better position to select an algorithm after you\u2019ve defined the objectives of your model and selected the data you\u2019ll work on. Some of these algorithms were developed to solve specific business problems, enhance existing algorithms, or provide new capabilities \u2014 which may make some of them more appropriate for your purposes than others. You can choose from a range of algorithms to address business concerns such as the following: As time and resources permit, you should run as many algorithms of the appropriate type as you can. Comparing different runs of different algorithms can bring surprising findings about the data or the business intelligence embedded in the data. Doing so gives you more detailed insight into the business problem, and helps you identify which variables within your data have predictive power. Some predictive analytics projects succeed best by building an\u00a0ensemble model,\u00a0a group of models that operate on the same data. An ensemble model uses a predefined mechanism to gather outcomes from all its component models and provide a final outcome for the user. Models can take various forms \u2014 a query, a collection of scenarios, a decision tree, or an advanced mathematical analysis. In addition, certain models work best for certain data and analyses. You can (for example) use classification algorithms that employ decision rules to decide the outcome of a given scenario or transaction, addressing questions like these: You can use unsupervised clustering algorithms to find what relationships exist within your dataset. You can use these algorithms to find different groupings among your customers, determine what services can be grouped together, or decide for example which products can be upsold. Regression algorithms can be used to forecast continuous data, such as predicting the trend for a stock movement given its past prices.Data and business objectives aren\u2019t the only factors to consider when you\u2019re selecting an algorithm. The expertise of your data scientists is of tremendous value at this point; picking an algorithm that will get the job done is often a tricky combination of science and art. The art part comes from experience and proficiency in the business domain, which also plays a critical role in identifying a model that can serve business objectives accurately.

Once identified, these patterns or relationships can be used to understand the behavior of the systems from which the data was collected. Modeling:\u00a0In conjunction with data mining, statistical models can be built from collected data. Models are built based on the context of what needs to be predicted. Once built, new data can be input into the models to predict outcomes. For example, a sales organization can build a cross-selling model of existing customers to predict what other products they\u2019d be most likely to buy from that company. Machine Learning:\u00a0Machine learning uses iterative methods and techniques to recognize patterns in large datasets and build models. Applications like recommendation engines for online shopping incorporate machine learning into their software. These engines make product recommendations based on predictions made from past customer buying and browsing behavior.Classification\u00a0models Regression\u00a0modelsFor customer segmentation and/or community detection in the social sphere, for example, you\u2019d need clustering algorithms. For customer retention or to develop a recommender system, you\u2019d use classification algorithms. For credit scoring or predicting the next outcome of time-driven events, you\u2019d use a regression algorithm.Is this customer likely to respond to our marketing campaign?
